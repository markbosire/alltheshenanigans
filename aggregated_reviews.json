      "Don\u2019t ever think to have any business with this company!!!! They rescheduled my shipment 4 times without any notice, and every time I call the customer service they say \u201cwe are sorry\u201d \u201cit will arrive soon\u201d. They keep lying and lying every time. You track your shipment online you see its out of delivery, you wait home to get your package then by the end of the day it\u2019s failed to be delivered and rescheduled!!!! And no body called me!! YOU WASTE YOUR TIME AND YOUR ENERGY AND YOUR MONEY!!!!! The worst company !!!!!!!!!!! STAY AWAY!!!!",
      "This\u2019s very poor company there will took to much time to deliver your order I think they are arriving from Pluto",
      "The worst customer service\u2026 \nI try to access the application to schedule the delivery it gives me Access Denied! And when I call 80074472 no one is answering\u2026. So how can I get my shipment from you???\nVery bad experience.",
      "The worst customer service ever. When you do talk to someone they just lie to you..\ud83d\udc4e",
      "If there was an option for negative stars I would have used it! The worst ever courier company I\u2019ve had to deal with! They have one driver who shuffles every morning between Dubai and Abu Dhabi, so orders to Fujairah and other emirates are totally ignored. They have my package for three days and still haven\u2019t delivered it after numerous calls and complaints. It\u2019s a shame that a company like Samsung is using them for deliveries and not other more reputable and reliable companies. Apple and iPhone will remain my choices for the future, I\u2019ve never had an issue like this with Apple. Samsung-change your delivery company!!",
      "Document couldn\u2019t be delivered, no refund... the only thing working is the chat module.",
      "I haven't had an experience yet! I have placed order to \"carry\" a TV from on point to another in 3 days from the time of placing the order. I receive a call a day before the pick up apologizing for not being able to \"carry\" the TV due to its size. This is a real shame. Promising big and delivering small, in this case, not delivering at all! And the worst thing is, the customer service give an alternative date or try to find a solution! It's like she doesn't care if I use their service or not! This is just a perfect example of how to fail on \"carry\"ing.",
      "I had high hopes on this app and after using it for 3 times and in three different occasions I've got to say: This is one of the worst customer experiences I've ever had with a service app in the UAE. They never keep up with the time promise, they don't deliver to the right address, the customer service representatives sound like a they are talking from their houses, and worst (and worrying) I get charged from my credit card while the app shows an error! This is simply the perfect recipe for failure, it's as if they're not even trying. What a bunch of hacks!"

      "I have belonged to a gym for years that used the Mossa program then I moved away. So happy there\u2019s an app I can still do my group active classes with Mossa. Thank you so much!",
      "It would be helpful to have a hamburger menu to jump to workout sections.\nLove MOSSA!",
      "I did MOSSA workouts at my local YMCA for years prior to the pandemic. I was thrilled when they made the app available for anyone to sign up during COVID times. Now I can work out whenever I want to. there are so many different workouts to choose from. Even after years of using the app I am finally exploring all the options. My only beef with the app is that the user needs to be able to organize favorites in some usable way: type of workout, by time of work workout, etc. with my comments attached.",
      "Absolutely amazing library - I recommend to everyone!",
      "These are the same classes I take at the gym.  The instructors are top notch.  I love the convenience of working out at home.",
      "Group Power, Group Active, 3D-30, and really anything Mossa is fantastic.  Programming and music are second to none.  Mossa on Demand got me through the pandemic.  The workouts change your body and your mind!",
      "I used to be a regular at my gym that had MOSSA classes and then moved to a small town with the closest gym 30 minutes away. I am so happy to get the same experience at home and even workout with a trainer from my old gym (hi Mark!) The cost of the subscription (and equipment for Power) for the variety of regularly updated content is totally worth it.",
      "I\u2019ve been a subscriber for at least 5 years and I still love this program!  There are so many options and there is something for everyone and all fitness levels.  I highly recommend this to anyone, especially if you\u2019re looking for something that you can use any day of the week.  I\u2019ve done the R30 (spin), Power, Core, Blast, and Centergy.  \nThe instructors are top notch and the workouts are very easy to follow.   5 stars from me!!",
      "MOSSA workouts are the best! The music is always great, and I love how the workout is choreographed to the beat. Makes the workout so much more enjoyable and effective. Highly recommended!",
      "I have been using MOSSA On Demand for almost 3 years now and it is amazing. The workouts are varied and can be modified for any fitness level. They are constantly updating workouts and adding content. They also have segments that explain the reasons behind the different types of movements and programs. Technologically, there has been no issues. The videos play and the audio is excellent. I would highly recommend this program.",
      "All workouts seem exactly the same",
      "I had joined MOSSA in April 2020 because I loved the classes at the gym I belonged to so thought I\u2019d try out the app.  It was okay but there weren\u2019t very many classes on the app at that time.  Fast forward to NOW and I\u2019m absolutely amazed at all the class offerings and options (those combo classes - what?!?)!  I\u2019m so excited to get back at it from home.  It still feels like I\u2019m in a group class at the gym but I can do it on my schedule.  Thank you MOSSA!!",
      "Fun and motivating workouts \u203c\ufe0f  Absolutely the best instructors \u203c\ufe0f  Thank you Mossa \u203c\ufe0f",
      "As a former Mossa instructor, I was looking for a fitness option when I travel. So many of these programs do not require equipment OR I can use it at a gym using their equipment.\nI also dusted off my equipment at home, from my instructor days, so I can do Group Active and Group Power at home, where there are no facilities within a reasonable distance that offer these amazing Mossa programs. I do however miss the community you get in the live group fitness setting.\nThank you Mossa!",
      "A good way to get moving without it feeling like a chore. I do the group centergy and group fight",
      "This 70 year old guy loves the 60 min group power workout sessions. They are really good for me. I do one every four days on the same session for 6 times and then move the next one in the series. Finally up to #19.. It's amazing how they are all different but equally good. Kudos to the session leaders !!\nAlso - the workouts are best on a big screen (apple TV) but in a pinch the iPad screen will still get you going just fine...",
      "I\u2019m not one of those fitness freaks. I love the ease of getting into this app and finding workouts that fit my pace. Great music too",
      "Used to drag myself to the gym for MOSSA, but with 3 kids and a full time job, it rarely fit my schedule. Now I wake up at 4:30 every morning and pick whatever MOSSA program I\u2019m in the mood for! My favorites are Centergy, Power, Active, R30, and Fight (I\u2019ll also Groove on occasion). So grateful to have this!",
      "This app has it all. So grateful for the variety and quality of these workouts. No getting bored or tired of seeing the same leader. No matter what your fitness goals are MOSSA has an answer for you.",
      "I downloaded this app at the beginning of COVID because my Gym shut down and these were the workouts they used.  I bought the equipment, but they even have routines if you don\u2019t.  Instructors and routines are all great, and they can be modified for any level.  What I like best is they have 10 minute, 30 minute and roughly 60 minute workouts, so they fit into what ever schedule you have.\n\nLove this app!",
      "The upgrades have made the app worse than before. First, what took three clicks to get to a workout now takes six or more. They have added pictures that fill up the screen to make it pretty but took away ease of use.  Second, before the upgrade I could cast the video from my phone to a tv and see the video on both screens. This is very helpful so that my phone can be on the floor when I\u2019m there for the workout. Now, the phone is blank. I contacted support and they said tough luck\u2014it\u2019s just the way the new app is designed. So, for a so-called upgraded app that now costs more per month you get less functionality. What a deal. Once the pandemic ends I look forward to canceling my subscription.",
      "I\u2019ve been kickboxing and lifting weights at home for 20 years, and discovering MOSSA Fight on Xbox a few years ago truly brought me to a new level of badassery and fun. When Xbox got rid of it I was at a loss, so I got in touch with MOSSA and they released the workouts via DVD first, then streaming. These workouts use the BEST music you will find. The workouts truly use the music - for example, with a punch or kick you might hear breaking glass. Or during weight lifting, they will time each lift to the beat but the beat is varied, like: 1,2,3 (pause) 4! (Repeat). Believe me you will want to turn up the volume and the time will fly! After 20 years it was great to learn some new MMA moves too, several actually. I also enjoy their Centergy series, it\u2019s a mash up of yoga and Pilates, great balance work too. There is something for everyone: dance, yoga, weights, step, bike, HIIT, etc. They have 10 minute workouts that you can combine to get a variety, or just do when short on time. Most workouts are 30 minutes so you could do two different ones. And recently they\u2019ve added 60 minute workouts. I\u2019ve been streaming this for a few years, since they started it and each year we got new additions. The app always works for me via my Apple TV without issues unlike my other fitness program. I\u2019ve never left an app review before but I figured it\u2019s time for me to show my appreciation to MOSSA and try to spread the word. Amazing music, trainers and workouts.",
      "Best at home cardio burner! Tones your legs!",
      "Will update to 5 stars... Looking forward to the new material and the 60 minute workouts! Love the multi directional movements and balanced exercise routines.",
      "So I had this app for a few months and it was great. Loved the work outs and even bought all the equipment. Well, I resubscribed and all the app does is crap. Tried my fire stick, iPad, and iPhone. Just keeps telling me to activate my already activated subscription. After 2days of the same thing over and over, I cancelled. Not worth my time or stress to try to log in.",
      "I enjoy the mossa series workouts. My only complaint is that new workouts should be added more frequently. Ie. core",
      "Love MOSSA MOVE classes on their app!  They have a variety of different classes that keep you motivated.   Some of my favorites are fight, blast, core, and power! The best part is that you can go at your own level giving you instructors on the platform showing you what to do!  MOSSA has helped me stay in shape during this pandemic!",
      "I signed up for an Auto subscription for MOSSA Move, it has been processing the past few months. It did not auto renew in August. When I try to manually renew, it just says pending, and now I can\u2019t access the app! What do I do? I tried to report a problem to Apple, but they don\u2019t address these issues - is it a problem with this app? Please help!",
      "Workouts are great even without equipment. Almost like being back at the gym!",
      "Who says you need 60 minutes or more per workout session to improve your health and fitness???? These 30-minute, cutting edge programs are packed with energy, awesome soundtracks and the world\u2019s BEST instructors! \n\nThe 30-minute formats are a great compliment to the 60-minute MOSSA programs offered in elite clubs world-wide. It is nice that they are not simply a \u2018club class\u2019 watered down to a half hour. They have different moves and a totally different training effect.\n\nThank you MOSSA for your continued push to make exercise more innovative, fun and accessible to all.\n\nPS: for those who haven\u2019t tried a \u2018live\u2019 class at a club, find a gym in your area that offers these amazing, results-driven programs!\n\n~Peggy Gregor",
      "Great exercise and fitness levels options!! Just need more groove classes!",
      "It\u2019s still disappointing to me that they rarely add new content. And now a video that has been there for more than a year is labeled as new which is a little confusing. But what is there is great quality and makes me eager for more!",
      "Update: will not work with Vizio smart cast. Unfortunately for me that\u2019s big tv in the room with the most space. \nWorks well with chrome cast. \n\nMossa workouts have helped me lose weight. Programs are fun, and never get dull. Many great programs to try. \n\nI used the app on the Xbox when it came out, and I\u2019m glad they have made an app now!",
      "Love how simple it is to navigate the app. I mostly login on my laptop to do the workouts. The 30 minute format is the right amount of time for each workout and if I\u2019m feeling good I\u2019ll do. Second. I would love to see Centergy added to the list of workouts.",
      "I love doing the Fight and Core workouts on this app. Great music, energetic trainers, a lot of work and a lot of fun. There are some functions that need improvements, however. If I need to pause the workout to refill my water or catch my breath, the entire workout starts over and there is no option to fast forward or backward to find where I left off. Is there a fix to this yet?",
      "I have been waiting for this app since Xbox got rid of Xbox fitness. I\u2019m super excited to get back to my workout routine."

      "Signed up for live previews of new releases. Couldn\u2019t get on even though I refreshed everything. This happens all the time. I\u2019m canceling for good this time",
      "This app is reasonably priced and has a lot of variety with and without equipment.",
      "I am not sure what happened. Things got worse.\n1. I can no longer control the class within the app using my wireless headphones. I used to be able to pause by touching my headphones.\n2. The fast forward button during a class skips me to the next class I have downloaded.\n3. I can\u2019t find a way to skip ahead a few seconds or behind a few seconds without trying to manually move the timeline.\n\nPerhaps this is something on my end, but it is corresponding to a new look in the app. It is much less user friendly.",
      "This company\u2019s apps / technology are very frustrating to use. I waste so much time having to figure out how to fix issues.",
      "I have been paying for several\nMonths and every time I try to click on class it ask to subscribe but I\u2019m already a paying customer... my acct renews on 14 th every month and I have not be able to access one class for months!!! I have tried emailing and haven\u2019t gotten any support! VERY FRUSTRATING",
      "The app, nor the website, are able to handle the number of people that are signing up right now. It\u2019s terrible. Please update to handle the capacity."

They were fast, easy to use, and they were patient and kind when answering questions I had. It was really convenient as I could get it done at home and didn\u2019t have to drive 30 minutes to a shop. I was able to get it done before work, with enough time to spare to get breakfast! I loved it, and appreciated the customer service.",
      "It can be perfectly pinned and they won't find your car. Then they will cancel while you are in a meeting and you will be gas-less. It happens every single time. It's a great idea in concept but the app execution has you dragging your pin to a picture!!!! It's never accurate enough for people",
      "Sadly, I\u2019m ineligible for this service since I live in an apartment complex. It\u2019s a let-down, but that\u2019s not Yoshi\u2019s fault. Looking at the app, it looks like a fantastic idea. I hope y\u2019all can find a way to expand soon.",
      "Absolutely love Yoshi\nEspecially on those days when life gets busy.",
      "Be aware, they do not send any notification via email or msg or something else for charging you the subscription fee. I used to use this app but did not reinstall it on my new phone, and until recently I noticed that I have been charged for monthly fees for almost 2 years without any notification until I noticed an unknown bill on my credit card statement. I talked to the customer service, and they only agreed to refund me for the most recent few months. It is ironic that they remembered to send me every ad and promotion email except for this most important one.",

      "Yoshi is a time saver and that in and of itself makes it AWESOME. Furthermore, the service drivers are always professional and the convenience of being able to have the service done at a time that works for me is a huge bonus.",

      "It\u2019d be nice if they offer medium grade fuel. Not just regular and premium",
      "I really love Yoshi. \nI work at GM and they\u2019re there regularly. It\u2019s so convenient and with the price averaging, I usually end up getting my gas cheaper. \nYou can set up weekly visits. I get a fillip every Friday. If I need gas midweek, I just hit the buttons and when I come out of work on the scheduled day, my gas tank is full. I have severe asthma and standing in the Michigan winters, windy days, or humidity, makes my chest tight and I\u2019m thankful. I no longer have to stand at a gas station at night (and worry because my city isn\u2019t safe) because I planned on getting gas before work and then was running late. I\u2019m a procrastinator and it\u2019s so nice. \nThey average prices. So you get the best. \nThey do upgrade stuff. Fluids and other things like wipers. \nI was off work for a few weeks and I just hit the \u201cskip fill up\u201d button and it was easy peasy. Every time I\u2019ve they text me the reminder that they\u2019re filling my car up, and had I\u2019ve had to text them back, they\u2019ve always answered promptly and very kind. \nI honestly think, unless you enjoy going to the gas station for fountain drinks, this eliminates the gas station all together. \nThey send you a reminder \nThey fill up your gas \nThey text you a picture afterwards with the amount of gallons \nThen they send you an email receipt \n(that tells you all the local gas station prices within a certain mile radius). \nI\u2019m going to schedule my daughters car too because she runs out of gas constantly and it\u2019s super annoying. I think it\u2019s great for anyone, but especially ppl who can\u2019t stand to stand in extreme weather, disabled, elderly, or forgetful spoiled children. \nI\u2019ve never had an upgrade so idk about that but the only thing I do is make sure my gas tank is unlocked and let the magical wizardry that is Yoshi do it\u2019s thing. \ud83d\udc51",
      "Yoshi is a fantastic service. It\u2019s so nice to not have to worry about having to touch a gas station pump or having to wait for a slot at somewhere like Costco.\n\nI currently get gas every 2 weeks or so, so it\u2019s nice to have a set schedule. And they even come early in the morning between 4 and 9 if you want, so when they do my gas (and anything else) between 4 and 8, it\u2019s all done before I have to head off to the office.\n\nThe customer service is very easy to reach too, just a text message away. If there\u2019s an issue pumping your car or doing some other service, they\u2019ll text you right away and give you a few minutes to fix the issue if needed.\n\nI\u2019ve had issues with some of the sub-services like not pumping my tires full of air when I asked, but all in all, it largely works. And when they didn\u2019t do the service, they refunded me that additional fee quickly.\n\nObviously if you don\u2019t drive very much or have a very short commute, this app really isn\u2019t for you. But if you like the convenience of not having to go to a gas station, this is a good app to get.",

      "I absolutely love the Yoshi service!! It\u2019s so convenient!!  If I have an issue or need to change my schedule I can just send a quick text and I know a real person will see my message and her issue fixed or change my schedule.  I definitely recommend this app to my friends and family!",
      "Not worth the extra $20 monthly fee \nOnly convince is getting gas delivered, but if you add gas fee with monthly fee you are actually paying more. \nI\u2019ve had this app and used their service for almost about a year now, it\u2019s started off good, I a fill up scheduled once a week and a car wash twice a month. Lately my service have not been consistent. I would have service scheduled with a time frame. After realizing the service have not been rendered, I reach out to them and ask, if they are running late and forgot to notify me? \nAll I get is sorry would you like to reschedule? \nI did, didn\u2019t think much of it but was upset with the fact that I scheduled my service around my work schedule and lunch time. Now I received an email yesterday stating that effective Yesterday evening they will place a hold on my card for $60 and if there\u2019s a fund it will take 2-3 days to get it back. \nOkay, but you\u2019re informing the customer of this change not a month a head or even a week a head. Your information them that this became affective the day before they even receive the email or notice. Although not my case, but I understand some people don\u2019t pay their bills or cards get cancelled or maxed I don\u2019t know what the case is, but customers should at least get more time notice of such changes. \nWhat will change next? The monthly fee will go up for sure.  Don\u2019t bother with this app or service.",
      "If getting incredibly discounted premium quality gas delivered directly to your vehicle wherever you are parked for at least 4 hours isn\u2019t enough for you to use this app then it should definitely lay be the customer service. \n\nI must say I am wildly impressed with the direct and personalized service that is offered to the customers of Yoshi. My only small issues with it is that their operating hours can be a but tough with such large windows. But I am sure as they grow they will be able to offer more extended hours. And I do hope they grow to have all the success!\n\nPs I haven\u2019t tried their add-on car wash services yet, but my neighbor uses it too and they are thrilled.",

I love Yoshi and I tell everyone about it. The price is very reasonable when you think of all the time you save in a year!",

A simple zip code check would have sufficed instead of forcing me to divulge my email, address, license plate, etc. My time was wasted and now they have a huge amount of info on me.",

This company is changing the game and helping save the environment at the same time. Thanks Yoshi!!!!",
      "I absolutely love the convenience of using this app. The only problem I\u2019m having is on fill up day I have to open and close out the app a couple times in order to put my location in. In all honesty that is such a little problem compared to how fantastic Yoshi is.",
      "Surprised to see this company not up and running in the SFV. Will change my review if they come to this area. I\u2019ve been searching for a service like this. Was excited but was let down. I live in Calabasas, CA, 91302 and work in Woodland Hills 91367.",

      "I\u2019ve been using Yoshi for several months and they\u2019ve been consistently reliable, accommodating to any change requests I give them (like when I switch locations at last minute), and being very quick to respond. I have enjoyed saving time by not having to fill up my SUV every week - Yoshi does it for me while I\u2019m at work!",
      "Love the convenience and no touch service.  Fuel is now one less thing that I need to deal with.",
      "Of all the startups out there aiming to make life a little easier, Yoshi is up at the top of our list.  With 2 little kids were constantly in danger of running late, and never having that \u201caw crap, I need gas\u201d moment when you\u2019re already late is so amazing.  And their gas is often cheaper than where I would normally fill up so the $16 a month is actually less than that when you factor those savings in.  Customer support is awesome too.  Seriously... give it a go.",
      "This is soooooooooo convenient!!! I love not having to pump my own gas. It\u2019s worth the money.",
      "How wonderful is it to walk outside to a spotless, fully-fuel car to drive home?! Amazing- superlative service with a courteous and professional staff.",
      "They won\u2019t say if they serve my area unless I download the app and then they immediately want all of these details about me and my car before I even know if they service my area. No thanks!",
      "I am not technologically hip. So thinking of using an app to manage a mechanical function like filling the gas tank sounded complicated. \nBut it is EASY. And so convenient. I can reschedule easily when necessary, have my tires checked as needed, and pay a very good price for the gasoline. The convenience and time savings more than make up for the reasonable service fee. I am a happy Yoshi supporter",
      "This is probably the best service ever! I cannot remember the last time I\u2019ve actually been to a gas station. Yesterday my tire indicator came on and when I discovered that Yoshi checks tires, I fell even more in love!  Thank you for your service!",
      "I hope I never have to go to a gas station again. Feels like luxury.",
      "My gas fill up, oil change and car wash we\u2019re all booked very quickly and Yoshi was very responsive via text with suggestions",
      "Very fast. Dependable. Pricing is fantastic $",
      "I loved the service. Weekly delivery. Saved time. Good rate. And then they cancelled me without explanation and refunded me. Even though I also had two months credit that would be added to the renew of my contract that I never got to use. Just terrible customer experience. If they\u2019ve relocated out of the area. Just say that. If you\u2019re bankrupt. Say it. Don\u2019t just snatch away the service. But it doesn\u2019t matter now with covid. But would be awesome during covid. Who wants to touch a gas pump even with gloves now.",
      "They don\u2019t even service none of the addresses I inputted. I stay in a nice neighborhood as well.",
      "Yoshi is great! Love not having to think about getting gas - they fill up at my home or office and it\u2019s super convenient!",
      "The amazon of fuel delivery. Conveniently affordable. No more touching gas station pumps for this germaphobe. Best thing since social media",
      "Love Yoshi! Always polite and helpful.",
      "One of life\u2019s little hassles you never knew could go away has gone away!    Love my Yoshi!  Love Larry!  He fills me up.  Love Rachel who is always quick and kind when I text needing a change or to update.  LOVE that I can go all winter and never stand out in the freezing breeze trying to get gas while I\u2019m running late.",
      "This has been the best addition for us. On my day off or morning off, I know gas will be delivered and I don\u2019t have to worry about it any other time. Saves us so much time and our Yoshi man is wonderful!",
      "I cannot say enough great things about this service. They have the best communication and customer service. They go above and beyond. I had a flat tire once at work and they rerouted their technician to come help me out!",
      "This is a great concept, except for the fact that every time they go to process my payment there is an error and they cancel the service I booked immediately, if I can even get that far.  What\u2019s the use of offering this service if they can\u2019t process the requests?",
      "When I started using this service a few months ago, they had major issues with keeping appointments.  It was very frustrating so I cancelled. They tried to gain me back but I declined until one day I told myself to try it again.  They said they hired more drivers and could now accommodate the demand and they were right. They have not cancelled an appointment yet. I\u2019m a very satisfied customer now and very glad I came back to them.",
      "The most expensive thing at the gas station is your time. You can make more money, however you cannot make more time.",
      "I\u2019",
      "Use it every week",
      "Love this app idea. Gas delivery to your door with ease? Sign me up.. but make sure not to have any issues because customer service will not respond to you. Great app just dropped a ball on their service. I\u2019ve emailed them 3 separate times in regards to account issues and a month later, still have not received any help. Save your time, go somewhere else. Cool concept but huge fail",
      "Yoshi is one of the best delivery gas company. Always applies on quickly when needed to change my service or add stuff. They have morning fill ups which is the best cause when I wake up my car is gas up and sends my a msg when my service is complete. Saves me time from having to go find the cheapest gas station during rush hours here in Los Angeles.",
      "I\u2019ve been using Yoshi for about 3 months and not only has it helped me save over $500 on gas but the service is spectacular how they deliver the gas to you. I don\u2019t have to wait for long gas lines! Honestly highly RECOMMEND!!!",
      "Amazing app amazing service have already recommended to all my friends and coworkers",
      "Such a huge fan of Yoshi! I haven\u2019t gone to a gas station for about half a year now and I am living for it! They make it so easy to reschedule, and give you plenty of notice day of if you need to make changes. Love that their extra services can contribute to savings on gas as well.",
      "I really like using Yoshi. Not only is it convenient, but it\u2019s safer, a time saver, and who likes getting out in the cold or heat anyways?! Yoshi is seriously a life saver.",
      "My whole house uses Yoshi! We have 3 cars they service at our home and we love it. The concept alone is worth it, but the thoroughness in the service is even better. They are super clean and I never question if the gas actually came. I literally get at the minimum 2 photos to verify my fill up and the best part is they text the rest of my house when I have a fill up scheduled to see if they also need service.",
      "Funny story. I used to be a smoker, buying cigarettes and gas was my gas station trip. I haven\u2019t been to a gas station in a few months and neither have I smoked a cigarette. Thanks Yoshi.",
      "I love using Yoshi! The app is super easy to use and customer service is always really helpful! Really convenient to not worry about having to get gas late after work or early, just schedule and leave my gas flap open!",
      "This is legit the best thing I have found on the App Store. Yoshi saves so much time. Makes getting gas convenient.",
      "I\u2019ve been using yoshi since March this year and loving every minute of it. They have saved me over 400 bucks in gas and keeps my hands clean from pumping my own gas. If you haven\u2019t at least tried it you are missing out. Yoshi is a life changer so get on the ball.",
      "I love the convenience. The GUARANTEED lowest price in the area. The time saved. I\u2019m in Cleveland OH, so not having to deal with the ever changing (snow/rain) weather conditions! I can\u2019t imagine being without YOSHI!!! Get it, you will love it!!!!!",
      "Sounds great, until they continuously flag your account for fraud\u2014 request you send over copies of your license, debit card, vin, etc. When they notice you\u2019re of color they will follow up with an email saying that despite all your very personal information being legit,  their team has randomly (with no reason) decided you can\u2019t use their platform.",
      "I love this service! I regularly forget to fill my car with gas, and end up having to plan around it at the worst times. Not anymore! I have been a faithful Yoshi member for 2.5 years, and I\u2019ll never go back.",
      "Outstanding service. I love this service and the savings I receive!",
      "I downloaded the app and the first thing is to put in my phone number. Well I\u2019ve tried several times and I don\u2019t get a pin, so I can\u2019t use it. \n\nNo option to call. No option to make an account online. No option to verify via outbound text or by email.\n\nOkay well I guess I\u2019m not using your service then\n\nUpdate!! SUPER sketchy stuff that they\u2019re doing\n\ntried to make a new account today with a new number. Both my accounts were flagged for \u201cfraudulent activity\u201d and they closed them, took away my credits, and left my card on the new account so it would be auto charged \n\nWhen I contacted support they refused to talk to me because they said the number I was texting them on was not on any accounts. Did not offer other way for me to talk to them",
      "This is a great idea for gas and the pricing is always lower than your local gas. Did I mention you need to make almost no effort, just need a 4 hour window where you car will be parked they come to you and fill up your vehicle. Also the gas used is quality gas. I used them for all my vehicles \n\nUse promo code Dannys3f95 for .99 gas",
      "Great service, they only lost me once..",
      "If you\u2019ve never had someone take car while you are taking care of the rest of your busy day, you\u2019re missing out! Try it for a month and you\u2019ll never want to pull into a gas station again!",
      "The convenience of Yoshi coming to my workplace and pumping my gas is amazing! My tank is almost always full! They price match within 2 miles so gas is often $.20 less per gallon than anything near home. My company pays for the membership so I\u2019m actually saving money and so much time with Yoshi. Highly recommend!",
      "Great option to fast gas service. Saves tons of time for this Trauma RN",
      "I\u2019ve been with Yoshi since the beginning, and I love this service. They bring me gas , change my oil , fill my tires with air.  Time is something we don\u2019t have a lot of, and it saves me time. I also don\u2019t have to stand at a pump in -22 degree weather. It may seem like pumping gas doesn\u2019t take a lot of time .. but when you\u2019re outside In the cold every second seems like an eternity. Love my Yoshi service .",
      "Seriously one of the best time savers in my life. I hate having to stop before or after work, and with the cold season setting in...I'm excited to not have to go out to fill up!",
      "I just get a full tank every so often and I\u2019m good no waiting in lines or trying g to go on my break. They come to my work fill it up :) I love it!",
      "I had no idea how incredible gas service and car wash service was until I got Yoshi.  It is a game changer.  My car looks brand new after it\u2019s washed.  They are very flexible if you need to change dates and everyone there is so nice!  I highly recommend them!",
      "my gas tank was 1/4 gas and fill up and charge me for almost 13 gallons my car is acura ilx fits 13 gallons. my gas tank was not empty when they fill it up.  i compare it on a gas station sane price and milage and was 9 gallons i could fit on it. charge me almos 4 gallons more that they did not put. happen to me twice delete the app",
      "I love this service. Not having to think about gas ever has saved me countless hours in time and money. I absolutely love it, the customer service is phenomenal!",
      "Robert and Adam were a huge help and Gary did an amazing job on my car wash. Very speedy, waited less than 10 minutes before I was serviced. I also love the customer service aspect, Rachel is awesome and I prefer being able to text over talking on the phone. Will highly recommend.",
      "As a working mother with a husband that travels for work, so many things fall under my responsibility that could normally be shared with a spouse. Things that Yoshi has released from my worry-bucket: having a full tank of gas every week, oil changes, car washes, wiper blades & rainX. It\u2019s the MOST convenient service and everyone that finds out is so jealous of me until they get over themselves and try it!!",
      "I have been using this company for about a year now, and have no complaints whatsoever!\nThe cherry on top is being able to schedule a last minute fill-up as I cruised into my garage at work with only two miles left in the tank. Rachel and the team were super helpful, and had me filled up and on my way(without needing Uber) before leaving for the day. Do yourself a favor and download this app and service. You can thank me later!",
      "Convenient, great customer service and even with the $20 monthly fee, it\u2019s like paying someone a couple bucks to take your car to the gas station.",
      "Too many good things to say about these guys; the customer service is remarkable",
      "So happy with the customer service and the friendly techs that come fill up my cars twice a week! \nVery grateful with how they handle their customers and schedule their customers. \n\nI have never had a bad experience with them! \nThey\u2019re always so friendly, and I get really good gas prices!",
      "I really love Yoshi services. They are so accommodating and I will continue to use them",
      "I have tried to fill my tank up multiple times and it never works on my phone, im literally trying to put my new car into the app and it will not let me search my car , there is alot going on with this app and I need answers like immediately i have gotten so many people onto this app and it won\u2019t even work for me , i have a iphone 8 plus there should not be a problem",
      "This service could not be better. Customer service is excellent.  I love this.",
      "It\u2019s really nice to not have to stop for fill ups any more. And the price Yoshi charges me is less than the stations near my house. So it\u2019s an all around win for me. Time saving + money savings = a no brainer win. Thanks Yoshi for the great service!",
      "Nowadays you can get anything delivered to you, even gas for your car!",
      "I been using Yoshi for over a month. Not disappointed one bit. Even had Yoshi to come to a location other than home. Not a problem.",
      "Tried to use this app five times. They canceled every single time due to high volume. They need to manage their trucks and schedule better.",
      "I hate going to the gas station!!! This is a service every single woman should take advantage of!!!",
      "I am very grateful an happy for services provided my only issue is the waiting on my scheduled day it may say they will be here approximately at 10 but don\u2019t receive services till after 4pm so it puts me in a bind I\u2019m sure due to it being a newer company they are just short staffed tho so overall I\u2019m happy",
      "Too good to be true",
      "What a great Idea....gas delivery to your home plus other great services as well like oil change, wiper blades, tire check, car wash and more. As a female I love not having to stop to get gas...especially at night. And the promotion of .99 per gallon is better than a \u201cGroupon\u201d coupon. The quality of gas is top notch! For some reason\nI think it seems to burns slower. My second fill request got cancelled because the idea is catching on in the LA area and the demand was really high that day. YOSHI made it up to me and the next fill price was better than the .99 cent. I have passed the promotion onto several friends and family who love YOSHI too!  Rachel is my Custoner Serv Rep and she is always prompt with responses and very knowledgeable and friendly. Best thing I\u2019ve ever signed up for. \nDon\u2019t miss out!! Sign up now. You won\u2019t regret it!!\nBev",
      "Love YOSHI the only thing I don\u2019t like is the cancellations due to being overbooked",
      "I was scheduled for a fill up. Received confirmation the day of,they reached out to make sure I was still parked in the same spot. Then they text me a few hours later saying we\u2019re booked so you can reschedule in the app if you want. If you\u2019re booked why was I able to schedule and CONFIRM my service? I made sure to fix my schedule around this service and they completely disregard my time. Now that I\u2019m reading reviews it clearly is a common issue.",
      "This is my first ever experience with Yoshi. \n\nI scheduled a gas delivery service from the app for 8/12/2019 between the hours of 9am to 1pm (they ask you to schedule a time slot of at least four hours. Understandable). On my \"Yoshi day\", I checked the app for any and all updates regarding the service.\n\nFirst problem: When I checked the app, it had said that the ETA would be between 4:08pm and 4:38pm, which was SEVERAL HOURS past the time slot I had originally signed up for. The reason why I signed up for a 9am-1pm slot is because I had other things to do in another city. Yoshi lets you change your parking location only within a certain radius of your originally-scheduled location. Anything outside of that specified radius, and you'll have to change your delivery time and/or date. At that point, it started to feel like they were expecting me to waste my entire day and wait around for them. Very unprofessional.\n\nSecond problem: Not only did they totally disregard my allotted time slot, but that ETA kept getting later and later as the day went on. By around 3pm, their ETA had updated to around 6:30pm at the latest. \n\nThird problem: One of Yoshi's customer service reps reached out to me via text at 5:14pm saying that they won't be able to get to my car due to delays, commented that they are working on adding more fuel tech to my area, added a $10 credit to my account thinking that would make up for the sub-par service I experienced, and then canceled my service for the day.\n\nI totally understand that delays happen. However, why was I contacted so late in the day? Yoshi's operating hours are from 9am to 5pm. They had PLENTY of time to let me know that they wouldn't be able to get to my car, and schedule me for another day. I would have been okay with AT LEAST that. Again, they contacted me at 5:14, which is after they have concluded operations for the day. That's totally unprofessional, and quite frankly, a bit disrespectful. \n\nI appreciate the credit added to my account, but that hardly makes up for what I have experienced today. I have scheduled yet another gas service for tomorrow. How that goes will determine whether or not I continue using this app. For now, I feel this 1-star review is very well-earned, and I can't say that I will be recommending this service to any of my friends or family.",
      "I planned to fill up my tank since Thursday, only to be canceled Friday when I needed my gas. Wouldn\u2019t recommend.",
      "I\u2019ve been using Yoshi for 6 months now and I LOVE IT. It\u2019s nice not having to worry about filling up my gas, especially on those days when I\u2019m about to hit empty and don\u2019t have time to go to the gas station. The app is straight forward and easy to use. They even have someone dedicated to sending you text reminders that Yoshi is on their way for your services or if you just have questions you can talk to them directly. They text you once the service is complete and email you a receipt right after. I also like that they\u2019re good about the time frames you give them and are punctual.\n\nThe only thing I wish they had on the app was access to receipts/charges.",
      "There are a lot of cars in my family, and it\u2019s convenient for all of us to be together on Friday and have all our cars filled up while we catch up on the week =]",
      "So I finally decided to use the app because my trial period is almost up. I went on the app Wednesday during the day and scheduled a delivery for Thursday morning. Everything was confirmed and then the following day(morning of my delivery)I received an email and a txt saying their routes are full for the day and for me to reschedule. I sort of laughed when I saw this because I had a feeling something was going to happen. Anyways, I sent a txt message to the customer service number and she basically didn\u2019t really help much other then telling me to reschedule for next week. I\u2019m like but I need gas in my car before weekend. So frustrating and clearly they need to figure out scheduling, logistics, and the demand.",
      "Hands down, most valuable app!",
      "The simplicity of never having to worry about having to pump gas is great, especially with young kids. I never have to stress about going to gas stations or running out of gas! Plus my tech is super nice!!!",
      "I\u2019ve only been using the service for a few weeks but love it. The service is impeccable (somehow a promo wasn\u2019t applied - not sure if I didn\u2019t apply correctly or it was their error but they didn\u2019t question - they just fixed it immediately). And they are super responsive if you have a question or a hiccup with your timing/car availability. The gas is cheaper than I find anywhere near me. I have yet to match, let alone beat their price near my workplace. It seems like a luxury but I find it alleviates some of the stress of the pre- or post-commute scramble. Highly recommend! And the app is clear, easy-to-use, and with the parking pin is just cool. I like the text/email reminders and confirmations of service. Just very well done.",
      "If you are busy at work and dnt get time to refuel your car just Call Yoshi.\n\nI am using Yoshi since 6 months and very happy with fuel price and there awesome service.",
      "From the first phone call when a sales rep began bugging the crap out of me over and over to ask if they could fill up either of my vehicles I said no but I wonder if you could fuel my boat. Then she asked where it was parked etc I said a slip. Then we talked about the hose lengths and I said well it wont reach my permanent slip spot but I can find a place to park for the fill up and she said that sounds great. We talked multiple times after that and I told her I hadnt found a spot yet. Then I found one and even mentioned it was a boat launch and that I would pay for their entry to the ramp they said great. I cleared my afternoon on Monday after waiting for a response by email they said they couldn\u2019t make it. Then I cleared my work calendar again today for the whole day to accommodate then an hour before the window they tell me they cant do boats and have no way of telling me who bugged the crap out of me for the last 4 months! No thank you!!!",
      "My son deleted my app and downloaded again and asking me for my number to\nLog in and input it and keeps telling me he send me a code but I have not received anything! The app needs some fixing to do... it also wouldn\u2019t let me add a vehicle I would put the model and it wouldn\u2019t search anything up\n\nUPDATE: I texted them and they responded with my account has been closed for fraudulent activity when I have only used the app once and my friends just my code this past week so now I have .50 cent gallon of gas but now it\u2019s closed when I try to use to it but it wasn\u2019t closed when my friends try to use the code\ud83e\udd14 This is a SCAM as soon as your first time is over you try getting gas cheap again they shut it down! I will be letting my friends know not to refer because they won\u2019t be able to use it anyways!",
      "As a woman, it\u2019s nice to not go to the gas station. In my area it can be dangerous and I feel so good not having to deal with catcalling as I pump gas. Thank you!",
      "Yoshi has been a great app. It takes a minor annoyance and makes it disappear.",
      "The service is super convenient. I really do like it. Only drawback is that the price goes by the lowest in that specific zip code. I, personally, think they should go by lowest price in a several mine radius. More people would subscribe in that case. Then I could get gas at my home instead of my work, haha. \n\nAnyway, really awesome service and you give the window. Super convenient",
      "I have always said, when you pay thousands of dollars for a vehicle, it should roll down the road without doing anything to it.  Yoshi makes me feel that I have my wish.  I don\u2019t have to pump gas or sit while they change my oil.  I love Yoshi !!!",
      "super unreliable",
      "Never empty.  Never have to deal with gas stations.  Awesome service.",
      "I\u2019ve used this service for 3 weeks now and utilized fill ups, oil change, windshield cleaning and engine cleaner.  It\u2019s been wonderful. The customer service staff is polite and quick, the app allows for all sorts of flexibility in terms of scheduling and I find the services end up costing not much more than having to run out to do them myself.  A great value!",
      "My wife and I despise getting gas for our cars, because the gas station is always the opposite direction of where we need to go and it always adds about 15 to 20 minutes extra. Yoshi always shows up when we need it. I wish the arrival windows were just a little bit tighter to predict the arrival, but they always come on time and are very quick. Also the car wash service is the best I\u2019ve had done for the price. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",
      "I was very skeptical at first. However they came, filled me up, sent text w/pic proof and a receipt. I\u2019m totally sold. I will never go to a gas station again.",
      "Your on boarding is rage inducing. I downloaded the app, opened it to 3 permission modals that instantly triggered, before I could interact with them an animation popped on top of that with a rolling truck saying the app was downloading updates. The updates took longer than the initial download. Do your customers a favor and bundle that data into your core install. \n\nDuring the animation I get a text for a \u201cCSR\u201d to help me place an order. You haven\u2019t even given me the chance to interact with your product yet! \n\nAfter the updates animation the permissions modals are nowhere to be found. Set up my car data, then look - more pop up offers. $20 off a subscription with a sign up button. $20 off what bass price, what are the terms, where can I find out more before opting in?\n\nMinimized the app the write this review, pulled it back up to clarify a few details and the bottom half of the screen is solid white and the content all scrolls behind it. \n\nYou guys need to work on your UX. \n\niPhone XR\niOS 12.3.1",
      "-App is awesome now that it is improved \n-Services offered are great \n-super convenient \n\nBeen using them for about 6 months and I am very happy with the company. They keep improving and they were pretty good to start with. The only thing I wish they had longer hours/weekends.",
      "I was hesitant about signing up because I wasn\u2019t sure it was worth it. Well 4 months in now I can say... it is! I never have to worry about getting gas and they price match the nearest gas stations. Love it so far.",
      "Love this service. They are great and save me a lot of time. Sooo easy to us and work with!!!!",
      "Especially now that Yoshi allows more flexibility in scheduling\nGreat for young moms who don\u2019t want to lug their kids to the gas station",
      "I love this service. Specifically that I get a number I can get and receive text messages to. I don\u2019t always have time to make a phone call, but with Yoshi, I can text. The app is super easy and user friendly. Absolutely love the service!",
      "So convenient and so simple! I was just planning on using the free first month but after such an amazing experience I am for sure planning on continuing to use it! Makes life so easy for oil changes and car washes!",
      "Let's say you fill up your tank once a week. Let's say your car takes 11 gallons per weekly fill up. Let's say gas is $2.85 a gallon. If you fill up at a gas station, you would pay $31.35. If you use Yoshi, it will cost you about $29.15 at the discounted rate they offer, plus $4 from the monthly rate, you pay $33.15. Now let's say you fill up every two weeks and your car holds 20 gallons. At $2.85 a gallon, it would cost you $57. With Yoshi, it would cost $61. If you're a weekly filler, that's about $100 a year. If you're a biweekly filler, it's $104. Now if you're like me and you have a motorcycle that needs to be filled up every 2 days, that's an extra $100 a year. You\u2019re paying at least $100 a year for something you can do yourself. But you are paying for convenience. If you use this product and are happy with it, it\u2019s definitely worth it. If you live half a mile from the gas station like me, maybe not.",
      "I have Norman fuel my truck! Great time safer! Keep on growing. Rachel, the operator is super responsive and turns questions super fast!",
      "I love Yoshi because it takes the hassle away from visiting a gas station and have the gas station visit you it\u2019s even more convenience for women who don\u2019t like to pull in a gas station to pump gas !!!",
      "USE MY CODE FOR FREE GAS: GABRIELO6CE6\n\nI am very satisfied. This was my first time using yoshi and the process was incredibly smooth. Gas prices around me was 2.80 and they charged me 2.63$. Incredibly convenient to schedule weekly gas top offs to never have to worry about gas again. They also offer oil changes, car washes, etc. Etc. I used my friends code for 99 cents per gallon on your first fill up, and you could use mine as well! Mine is GABRIELO6CE6. 100% would recommend.",
      "For someone who has a busy life like myself, you save 30-60 mins of you life a week by allowing someone else to pump up you gas. Prices are reasonable, and they communicate via text. Love using them!",
      "The service and the app are awesome. I\u2019ve used Yoshi many times now, and it\u2019s always a great experience. It sounds too good to be true, but it\u2019s the real deal. I\u2019m telling my co-workers about it and they\u2019re using it, too.",
      "First time customer of YOSHI & must say I live everything about these guys. They were 45 min out of the service window but I won\u2019t be too critical on that at the moment. If you can\u2019t get an appointment for an oil service with YOSHI stop by Havoline Xpress @ 1953 Howell Mill Rd & I will be sure to take care of you. \nThanks YOSHI for the great service.",
      "I never liked pumping gas, especially living in Boston for 20 years. Yoshi services me at work and at home.  How convenient that they changed my oil and I never had to wait in a public lobby.  They offer great specials too! YOSHI is my new BFF!",
      "This is from far one of the most outstanding services i have ever used. Help is there all the way anytime you need it. The person shows up every single time and fills up the tank and i dont have to take the extra time to go to the gas station nor to put the extra miles for it. Its simply amazing and a tremendous help for anybody with a busy agenda. Highly recommended!",
      "I agreed with another reviewers that rant this lazy service.   I scheduled ahead by 2 weeks only to find my car not even filled.   I had to fill my car myself and called service that never come.   I m cancelling this.   I m sorry but you need to be on time or at least be nice to not reschedule without our permissions first.",
      "Yoshi is the best thing!  I love not having to stop for gas with my busy schedule!  The customer service absolutely amazing.  They work around your schedule anytime! Very friendly service and so convenient.  I highly recommend!",
      "Simple, easy to use app. Friendly service, flexible scheduling, very informative app, they indeed do have the cheapest gas price, professional and clean! Very pleased and happy. Life changer.",
      "I office near MSP and was so excited when I saw this service!  The personalized service I have received from Rachel and other Yoshi members has been top notch!  I didn\u2019t have to stand outside in a Blizzard to fuel my car.  Worth every penny to me!",
      "I have worked in customer service my entire professional career and I don\u2019t think I have found a better company to deal with. I always say people will buy from people not a business and Rachel and her team have always been very accommodating and professional with all of our needs. They are always prompt and continue to follow up multiple times a day. I would recommend Rachel and her team to anyone and as always I appreciate not having to ever worry when my next Yoshi day is!!! Thank you so much for all you do!",
      "First time customer! Super easy, seamless and very convenient.  I will be using this service moving forward!",
      "I\u2019ve been using Yoshi service for almost a year now, and I\u2019ve always been delighted with them. Rachel is unfailingly efficient and cheerful, and she gets things done! We got a Yoshi visit two days ago; yesterday we  realized only 1/4 tank had been pumped. I texted Rachel, who always makes me feel like we\u2019re on the same team. With apologies, she immediately set me up with another visit today. Now my car is reassuringly full, as well as clean, and I still think Yoshi rocks! I\u2019ve got some health challenges that make it impossible for me to take care of the routine things a car needs. Yoshi does them all for me, at a reasonable price and at convenient times. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without this team!",
      "The BEST! I never need to leave home for gas or service again. They come to my home! The follow up of their customer service is excellent. Texts and email reminders are sent in advance, and after service is complete. I tried another service first but it was inconvenient to travel to them at designated times. Yoshi is my new best friend.",
      "This is an amazing service. Easy on time saves you money. Why would you pay more and waste your valuable time when a genius came up with such a simple service. Courteous staff. \nThank you Yoshi. My family thanks you too.",
      "The flexibility of Yoshi is top notch. I can request a change to my delivery day on the same day, before the route starts and they ALWAYS fit me in.",
      "We\u2019ve been using Yoshi for several months and have been VERY HAPPY! Scheduling has been very easy, communication has Never been an issue, and the technician is so kind and thorough. One time I had an issue with timing because my special needs kiddo needed a little more attention at drop off in the morning at school, I was desperate for a fill up and was stressed about missing the service, so I texted Rachel (the switchboard operator) and told her the situation. When I pulled down my street there was Yoshi waiting for me by my driveway. At risk of sounding a little dramatic, it has been such a game changer to not have to worry about keeping my car filled up. It\u2019s one less thing and I\u2019m so so grateful! Thank you, Yoshi! I\u2019m a lifer!",
      "I've been using the service for a couple of months now. I love it!  So convenient and my customer service rep Rachel is so responsive and helpful.  Today I had a car wash and Bobby of Bobby Shine Shop that came was so nice and did an awesome job. \n\nDefinitely recommend and I do often.",
      "Be careful to download. I just wanted to look through the app and what it had to offer. I realized it was not for me and deleted the app. That should have been the end of it... Next thing you know I start getting emails. I unsubscribe. Then I start getting texts to start services. I asked them to please stop contacting me and remove me as a potential client. Next thing I know they are calling and leaving voice mails. The persistent badgering will not stop! Please do not download this App if you don\u2019t want to commit to being pestered.",
      "Good idea if it was available in my area. Before having to go through all the hassle of signing up and asking for my instant how about first you letting me know if it\u2019s available in my area",
      "Been loving yoshi for 2 years and they just keep getting better!",
      "Howdy! \n\nI was browsing through the AppStore for convenience services that enabled gas fill ups and car washes. \n\nThen I stumbled upon Yoshi! \n\nThe customer service rep was patient from the very start. \n\nAnswered all my questions and concerns. \n\nGot my first Gas fill up last week and was amazed with the gas mileage. \n\nGot mine done this week. Painless as ever. \n\nI highly recommend the service!! Never disappointed and the app does a fantastic job of keeping you posted. \n\nLove love love the service!!",
      "Yoshi is great... not only is it so convenient to skip a trip to the gas station every week (I\u2019m going to get so spoiled!), they\u2019re also excellent communicators. They tell you when they\u2019re on their way. They let you change the service date to the day of! And when they get there, they\u2019ll confirm via text that it\u2019s your car if you, like me, hadn\u2019t uploaded the VIN or tag yet. They\u2019re super pleasant and fun; we even sent emojis lol. They\u2019re also very responsive. They even took a photo of my car for the app. Couldn\u2019t ask for more!",
      "Rachel, the customer service rep goes above and beyond to make sure you are informed about the time of service and provides all the follow up information (picture & amount of gas). The redesigned app has a great user interface and is easy to navigate. Yoshi gets a 5 star review for saving me time & money when it comes to getting gas!",
      "Yoshi is an amazing service and I have been using it for years. Who wants to waste time in the cold or hot pumping gas weekly?  The staff are always available and willing to help with scheduling conflicts. I would highly recommend this service.",
      "Yoshi is awesome! Ran out of gas rolling into work, and they came and filled me up quickly! Rachael was such a great person to work with too. I highly highly recommend Yoshi!",
      "The app is so easy to use. I love that I can track the truck so I can know when to except yoshi! My favorite part about this service is convenience and it\u2019s super easy to schedule or change your delivery. Thanks for making this awesome service!",
      "Yoshi has the best service! Best text communication! I'm a busy working Mom and sometimes I forget (yes it happens) to put gas in my car. Yoshi has saved the day for me. Their customer is excellent and they are fast and reliable. They come my office to fill my tank up and I even got a few of my co workers to use them and they love the service. I 100% recommend Yoshi!",
      "I\u2019ve only had the service for a short time, but it\u2019s been working very well so far.  The customer service person in my area is excellent.  She is very responsive and has already shown great flexibility when I\u2019ve move my appointment days and parking locations.  Just today, screwed up by leaving my gas flap locked.  She had the service rep wait for me to walk to my car to unlock it.  When I arrived, the rep was very patient and gently explained the locking feature of the gas flap that I didn\u2019t even know about (I thought the flap did not lock but it does when I lock the car- who knew?). They could have canceled my service for today but they hung in there with me.  I\u2019m enjoying the fueling service and look forward to trying out more services stating next week (car wash probably).",
      "I\u2019m blown away by this company.  Super smart team really changing the industry.  I hate filling up my car.  The one gas station I used to go to would sometimes have a nozzle that jumped out, and once it spilled fuel all over my hands and outfit and I didn\u2019t have time to go home and change.  For a very low membership fee, I can have on demand gas fuel ups and oil change and car wash at my home! Genius! Exceptional communication with the app too and customer support.  I want to tell the world about this company.",
      "I literally watched just the Yoshi truck pull up to try to open my gas cap and when he couldn\u2019t he just drove away.  HE DID NOT EVEN TRY TO TEXT/CALL ME OR DID NOT NOTIFY ME THAT THEY WERE ON THE WAY LIKE THEY SAID THEY WOULD!",
      "I scheduled an appointment for an oil change two days before I was driving 300 miles down south. I was all excited because this honestly makes my life so much easier. I scheduled on Wednesday from 9 am to 1 pm but didn\u2019t get any notification about my car being done. When I looked on the app it rescheduled me for the following week. I woke up the next day and got a text at 4 am telling me my service was cancelled because they couldn\u2019t find my car. If they couldn\u2019t find my car, why was I not called? My car was right in front of them, I parked it right outside my place. They have my number for a reason. I tried to get it rescheduled but everything was booked so instead I ended up just getting my tank filled up and now about to drive to Jifffy Lube to get an oil change. The fact that I wasn\u2019t notified until the next day and that they weren\u2019t able to give me a new appointment because they were too lazy to call, really makes me upset with this service. I cancelled my membership. It\u2019s a great idea but they need to be on top of things more. Clearly I\u2019m not the only one who has dealt with this after reading these reviews.",
      "As an early adopter I like trying new services. They didn\u2019t show up for today\u2019s appointment and sent a text message indicating they are full for the day after having me confirmed. They are just not dependable. This was my second attempt. Not worth considering.",
      "I looked at the last 10 posts on this app to see what a turnover ratio would be out of 50 stars with 33 with star marks. It scares me the fact that it\u2019s a 66% rate and looking on the service, this app sounds like a pump and dump, that is what AAA is for, the fact our generation is moving towards a bulk membership services is only going to create a bigger debt ratio economically. Think about it for each layer In the industry who switches to memberships lolz. Welcome to America where spending is a real problem.",
      "20$ monthly fee, so complicated to cancel.\nGood idea, but need to be fixed some details.",
      "I loved the idea of having these services brought to my doorstep but alas too good to be true.  The arrival window is too large which keeps you tied to the house waiting on gas.  Also scheduled services twice for a car wash.  Both times I paid 35 bucks for a car was which was only half done.  They didn\u2019t touch the inside of the vehicle not a crumb or floor mat was vacuumed.  It\u2019s was pretty annoying considering my local car wash does a decent  car wash for the same price. Unfortunately I couldn\u2019t get close to a decent car was with Yoshi.  Too good to be true.",
      "Yoshi has come a long way from what it was only a few years ago. The app is very intuitive and scheduling or delaying fill ups is extremely simple. Offering oil changes, carwashes and other maintenance items has made my life much easier. Highly recommend getting this service!",
      "Just got a marketing call from these people. I downloaded the app then deleted immediately because I didn\u2019t want to use the service. \n\nOne star for misusing my data.  Zero stars if I could.",
      "This service is fantastic. They\u2019ve been very eagerly working to get my business. Listening to my concerns, and addressing them, so I tried them out. First fill up, fantastic! Looking forward to trying them again.",
      "I\u2019ve been using Yoshi for a couple of months and have had an exceptional experience with both the service and support. We live in an area with crime at the gas stations so it\u2019s so nice to know I get to stay home and have my gas delivered. I find if I need to reschedule they always make it very easy. I leave my car in the garage and open the gas cap for the delivery truck- it\u2019s a simple as that.",
      "Love the new Yoshi app! The scheduled arrival time window is excellent - and if we need to change, we text Rachel who takes care of everything. We fill up our sports car and SUV weekly. \n\nLove the new price shopping match. We cancelled Costco because Yoshi is so easy and competitively priced. \n\nWant to try the tire pressure, car wash, and new blade services. Thank you Nashville Team Yoshi #KeepMoving",
      "Life is remarkably easier and more efficient due to using YOSHI.  The support and customer service is outstanding.  The service techs are friendly and patient (especially when forgetting to leave a gas flap open or leaving a car locked on accident).  Love this concept.  Keep movin!",
      "You will pay for delivery and for your gas might as well go to the store",

If you are going to make a claim please back it up with a little research of your own.\n     Sources: scholastic 6th grade science book, chapter on Photosynthesis.",
      "I do absolutely love the convenience of always having a full tank seeing as how gas is delivered the same time each week.\n\nI only wish that the pay by delivery option was a thing.  I don\u2019t always need to have 3-4 gallons delivered to top off my tank as my car is pretty fuel efficient and I don\u2019t always need a fill up.  Or maybe a 10 dollar a month option for those who need a fill up once every two weeks instead of weekly.",
      "App works great.  I\u2019ve never had a problem with it.  My wife loves that her car is filled up with gas while she is at work.  I also kept myself out of the doghouse by having Yoshi put on new wiper blades for my wife\u2019s car which I had been forgetting to buy off Amazon for weeks! \ud83d\ude0e",
      "I\u2019ve been using yoshi for over a year now. I love it. I\u2019ve never had one issue.  Excellent customer service.  Adding my wife\u2019s new car now.",
      "Their services are great and so easy to use!  I get my gas filled, car washed, and tires checked all while I\u2019m at work!  Nothing like coming out of work and seeing your car sparkle and shine from across the parking lot and knowing that you don\u2019t have to stop for gas during rush hour traffic!  And if you like in Silicon Valley, you know what I mean!",
      "I have been using Yoshi for over a year now and it is the best decision ever made. I haven\u2019t pumped gas (with my crazy schedule) in a year and I can\u2019t explain how awesome it is! And GREAT staff!",
      "It\u2019s being advertised in my area but not available. Kind of bummed, what a great idea! It would be nice to know if my location is available for services before I fully commit sending you my personal information.",
      "I love this service and using the app is so easy and convenient. I recommend it to everyone.",
      "I have been using for a little over a month now and just love the service completely",
      "This app sound good but I can\u2019t get service cause my location doesn\u2019t have service \ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude12and my free mount service went to waste and they want me to pay before getting my free service had high hope",
      "Customer service was exceedingly nice, and my cars were filled with gas without me being at home. The scheduling involved 5-10 texts.\n\nThis could be a great service for people whose gas stations are always busy.",
      "Yoshi gas refills save me time. It also helps me keep up on routine things that I always lose track of, oil changes, and wiper blade swaps on keep my car going strong.",
      "This service has changed my life. I signed up for the novelty of the service, but soon it became something that I relied on heavily. I don\u2019t even think about my fuel level anymore. Running out of petrol due to my busy schedule, or the late night service station pit stops after leaving the office are a thing of the past! Plus the app is clean and user friendly, and the customer service is second to none. This is a must for me, and I guarantee it will be for you.",
      "The app itself was a cool idea but it\u2019s their customer service that really contributed to my five star rating. They assign you your own customer service rep that you can text or email with questions (mine was Rachel and she was super helpful). Thanks Rachel and Yoshi for helping me get a full tank of gas without lifting a finger!",
      "This app is great. The people who help fill your tank can be trusted to do the job quick and right. This app has saved me lots of time and there\u2019s no more waiting in the long lines at Costco gas.",
      "Amazing! Support team is super patient and the staff is friendly and helpful! I got my tank filled while at work easiest thing ever. Worth a download!",
      "Great gas prices, and great way to schedule regular car maintenance (oil change, car wash, etc). Wonderful service. So convenient. And a beautifully designed app! I love it!!",
      "i usually get gas with this app now. pretty convenient",
      "Customer service kept telling me that services had been scheduled, then saying at the last minute they were unable to schedule the service and cancelling.  A great concept, but ultimately cost me more time than they saved me.  They should stick to fuel and not waste people\u2019s time by pretending they can provide other listed services.",
      "What they forget to tell you before you enter your credit card number is there is a $20 a month fee.",
      "So before you get started let me lay down some basic math for you. First off you have to pay a membership fee of $20 a month (which they give a free month when you sign up). The membership fee comes out to be about $0.65 a day(for a full year). The gas you can chose from is regular or premium unleaded. I chose regular which was $2.68 at the time. The current price of regular unleaded in my area is around $2.40, mid grade $2.64, and premium is $2.89. You only \u201csave money\u201d on gas when you order extra services. They didn\u2019t list the price of the services but showed how much you would save on gas. At the end of the day you are paying roughly $0.65 a day for a membership, then you add up the price of gas plus any extra services. Now with the extra services you add you will save money on gas alone, but you need to add up how many days you go with out filling up. I.E. you go 5 days without filling up $0.65*5=$3.25 plus add on the gas $2.68*gallons, then add the extra services then minus the discount they give you. I believe the highest discount I saw was $1.00 for an oil change. To me this is a complete rip off. You\u2019re not going to save any money and in reality you are going to spend a lot more money. I just hate when companies say their users \u201csave\u201d X amount of money, when they actually end up spending more money. I understand it\u2019s a delivery system which I expected the gas prices to be a little higher but I did not expect a membership fee, and when you add that membership fee into the price of the gas it\u2019s outrageously expensive. Maybe if they got rid of the membership fee or lowered it, it would be worth it.",
      "Set up gas delivery for 9-1p today they asked for credit card . I provided it even though I have a $50 credit . Then I got a text saying My service was canceled because my card was declined . I don\u2019t understand why my card is being charged prior to service . So I inquired with the infamous Rachel she said they have a pre authorized charge to make sure your able to pay the remaining balance of the service . I have a tiny itty bitty car even with premium gas it\u2019s only 20/25 to fill up not to mention I\u2019m not on E! But I\u2019ll digress . So I ask her how much is the charge and still no response . I only give it 1star because I like the idea of it but it needs to work and needs to be better explained . Waste of time . Also I\u2019m scheduled for delivery next week which I didn\u2019t ask for nor do I need . I can\u2019t delete my credit card I keep receiving error message . Since Rachel is all of a sudden so busy I would love for someone to make it so that I can delete my credit card info . I don\u2019t want to be charged for services I never received .",
      "App should allow users to verify if their area is serviced BEFORE we have to REGISTER!!! \nOnce you download is asks for your phone #, name, car info & address without even letting you check if it will work.",
      "Outstanding proactive customer service approach which makes the entire process even easier.  Happy to see Yoshi associated with premium fuel brands, Exxon and Mobil.",
      "I used Yoshi for the 1st time yesterday in the Tampa market!  Service was excellent, on time and quick.  I requested to fill my car at work through the app, a timeframe for delivery was provided to me and no problems. One product update I\u2019d like to see is usage history... in real-time. It would be nice to track.  Other than that, I loved it!",
      "First of all, I LOVE Yoshi and will never go back to actually pumping my own gas! I have used it a couple times for oil changes too, which is so convenient and no more expensive than other oil changes. I tell so many people about Yoshi. It\u2019s great. My only frustration is with the app. I have had several occasions where I change the location of my car for gas day or change the day I want my service, and the app defaults back to my usual settings. They get around this by sending me confirming text messages and asking me to drop a pin to confirm my order, but it would be really nice if the app were just a little smarter and the design more intuitive.",
      "Nice experience so far. Rachel is very helpful. Not sure if I can justify the extra $20 a month, but I love the concept knowing a full tank is but a click away.",
      "Getting gas is dumb. Having gas delivered is so much better. The customer service with Yoshi has been so easy. Having a text based customer service experience is super clutch compared to everyone else. Thank you Yoshi for saving me hours and hours of life by not having to go to a gas station!!!!",
      "Won\u2019t let me put in my vehicle to order gas so... thanks anyway",
      "Last week my wife took my truck to work. Neither one of us realized that it was low on fuel and she was going to be working super late and most gas stations are closed by a certain time. I downloaded the app trying to figure out something for my wife. Within a few minutes I got a text from Rachel saying that if I had any questions or needed anything, she would be glad to help. I explained my situation and she immediately reached out to one of her drivers in the area to see if it was a possibility. I was concerned about her being parked in a restricted garage, that they would not be able to get to it. Initially they said they didn\u2019t think it would work and we could have ended the conversation there and I would have been extremely pleased with the customer service provided because they tried to help in such short notice. But Rachel text me a few moments later and said if someone could give them access, it would be no problem and they made it happen same night. I could not be happier with this service. Highly recommend.",
      "Genuine review. Do not download or subscribe! Company hides vital information behind a credit card paywall and uses sketchy tactics. \n\nPlease please listen to this review and don't download this app!!",
      "Yoshi is amazing. I haven't had to stop at a gas station in 9 months, which is awesome as I hate getting gas. I always used to run out at the worst times...when I was late for a meeting, or at night (as a female I never felt safe stopping at a station at night). Now I don't have to give it a moments thought. My car always has gas. And I don't have to lift a finger or even be present when they fill me up. Such a great service! And everyone I've dealt with at Yoshi is extremely helpful and professional. I can't recommend it enough!",
      "Can't say enough good things about them!!",
      "Yoshi is the best! I definitely do NOT miss stopping at the gas station to fill-up!! \n\nThe App is easy to use and the customer service is \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb!! This service is a game changer!",
      "It's simple and makes my life easier. App's really clean, the service is really smooth. They come every Tuesday to fill up my car and clean my windows and I leave with a full tank. \nI've been using it for a couple months now, and will keep using it.",
      "Just gave the service a try, paid a very respectable and competitive price for fuel. The added convenience is definitely worth the added convenience.",
      "Great communication throughout the entire process.",
      "I was doubtful at first this could be worth it but boy was I wrong.  I arrive at work on fumes and leave with a full tank and a receipt on my cell phone.  They even check my tire pressure.  Their CS is top notch and easily accessible.  Between texting and email they get back to you quickly. I HIGHLY recommend!",
      "I was really impressed by the convenience. I got a free tank of gas for using it for the first time with the code alexs1763. Good customer service too.",
      "Amazing. Gas tank filled while I was at work. Seems like it's too good to be true - except it's not! #Stanford",
      "Yoshi's fantastic. Super convenient to have them fill up gas while your car is parked\u2014and at the same price you'd pay at a gas station.",
      "I arrived home only to realize I was on E and had an early meeting in the morning. Yoshi filled up my tank hassle free and I was topped off and ready to go by the morning.  I'll definitely use this amazing service again.",
      "So convenient! Incredible it's taken so long for someone to come up with a service like this. 10/10. Very well done. Amazing service. Friendly team! Recommend.",
      "Eliminating one more task from the daily grind enables me to focus on what's relevant (my business, friends and family) and eliminate time sinks.\n\nService and delivery as promised. I even got a friendly notification about my tire pressure (front right was 5 psi below the rest). \n\nFresh app and even cooler truck!",
      "I'm a commuter and I have to fill my tank up twice a week. After a long day, that used to be the last thing I wanted to do. Since I started using the Yoshi service I don't think about getting gas at all anymore :) luv it!",
      "My tank was on low, but I hadn't had a chance to refill due to my busy lifestyle. Plus, the gas stations near my house close at 10pm, which is when I usually have time.\n\nI ordered gas from Yoshi while I was at work, and my tank was full by the time I got out! App is easy to use and they send you text messages to let you know when they've filled you up.\n\nBest thing is that they deliver from 12am-5am, when gas stations tend to be closed (or maybe unsafe). The next morning you don't have to worry about getting gas and can just be on your way!",

      "Multiple cancellations and back and forth to schedule on text. The point of the whole service to avoid this.",
      "Horrible app. It shouldn\u2019t let you download unless it can actually deliver within your area. Plus why is there no Diesel option?",
      "Should ask zip code to see if you service it before collecting my information! Complete waste of time and now you have my data for no reason!",
      "Yoshi advertise that they charge their consumer the lowest price in a 2 miles radius. So if that\u2019s to be true. So if Mobile happens to be the cheapest price in a 2 miles radius. so let\u2019s just say for arguments sake that mobil or Shell which advertise tech A part of their service that they advertise. Am I receiving that particular product at a discount price. something that Yoshi actually advertise the cheapest price in a 2 miles radius. Or am I receiving something else at a lesser value. Potentially do harm to my vehicle am I really going to put Costco\u2018s gas in myVehicle. I think not! so before you do your homework ask questions where exactly are you getting your product from. If you get it from Costco at a price of 3.79 or regular and 3.93 premium. And you selling it to me at 4.50 with a subscription of $20. I don\u2019t see the full value.",
      "Yoshi service is great but the app is terrible. \nIt always defaults to signing up for weekly fill ups. I just want a fill up on the day I choose. You always have to remember to change this when requesting service. I have also signed up for a fill up at 6:30 in the morning and somehow the app change the request time to late afternoon instead of the morning.",
      "This is not a real app. They just collect your information. Do not give your real phone number/other info",
      "I did not appreciate the fact that I had to download the app, create an account to then be told they don\u2019t service my area. And of course sent me an email. I don\u2019t appreciate this tactic. Blocked their email address and will not use even they expand to my area",

      "I used this company for a while now. I have referred friends and family to be using this company and get them my referral code for them to see if they like it or not. To be honest they have horrible customer service and hardly show on time in the 4 hour gap they make you wait. Sometimes they even cancel on you saying that they can\u2019t make it when you have been waiting during those 4 hours for them to fill up your car. Literally I have been paying for a service that I have not be able to use since they keep on canceling when they are not responsible and negligent. Just recently they accused my account of fraud (out of the blue) with out telling me. I tried to make an appointment for a fill up and it didn\u2019t work and thought it was a glitch. I trying contacting them and still never got a reply. I had to go all the way to their website to try and find their email to contact them and after I told them I was having issues with my account they told me they flagged my account and canceled it claiming it was fraudulent. They claimed I had too many cars and addresses being put on the account. Hello, my car does not only go home- if I have more than one car I should be able to use it. If I have a rental car I should be able to use it. If my car is in a different location I should be able to use it. As long as my credit card is not being declined or being back charged claiming it\u2019s fraud what can you say is fraudulent. Better of getting gas myself and not have to waste all my time waiting for them. They made me late to work several times and cost me money!",
      "Seamless user interface through which the life changing (literally) service and quality of Yoshi\u2019s team and product are delivered.  5 stars for the app that you\u2019ll rarely need after initial setup as Yoshi \u201cruns in the background\u201d and removes the worries of gas fill-ups from your life, entirely.",

All of a sudden their customer service text number is not responding , the app does not allow you to cancel in your own they have to do it for you. But no one will answer, they have charged my account for services that I did not want and asked to have canceled. I have to go through the hassle of disputing this charge through my bank because these idiots won\u2019t cancel this membership. do not sign up with this company , you will never get your gas filled and will just be charge a monthly membership fee for absolutely nothing !!!! Stay away from this company",
      "They sent me an email stating they where going to cancel my membership tried messaging them and emailing them for a week and no response. Have two credits for 60c a fill up and they will go to waste on the 11th since app not letting me schedule a fill up service. Savings are great. But they constantly cancel or show up hours after your scheduled window. Many of my friends say it\u2019s an inconvenience, basically has to be a day where your car sits all day.",
      "I feel like they have too many members and not enough employees to handle the workload. They cancel a lot and I don\u2019t like that you can\u2019t call the company you can only text. I have referred a lot of people to them and I feel it\u2019s been a disappointment. The first fill up is always good but after that your going to be disappointed. Really thought this was going to be a good company but it\u2019s bs. I\u2019m complaining every week or every other week. They have an excuse for everything. Waste of time.",

Especially since I\u2019m using my debit card and my same card I used last week, now no one is responding and i feel like I got cheated out of my fill up",
      "Every time I order my appointment get canceled, they\u2019re definitely doing to much work that they can not handle I\u2019ve gotten canceled for 6 days in a row now. It\u2019s ridiculous, cheap gas and delivered gas is a great idea super convenient but this app can not execute this type of service. All i end up getting is a text with an empty apology that\u2019s wasting my unlimited texting plan",
      "Overall the app is very convenient, however the customer service via text messages is not so great.  Yoshi need an actual number to call to speak to someone directly versus waiting for a text response.  Also, stop canceling customers the day of, we take 5 hours out of our day to wait for you guys to show up only for you to cancel.",
      "Never was updated that I wasn\u2019t going to be able to get gas. I gave a broad window 9-4 and still nothing. This is so upsetting. Don\u2019t waste your time trying to get happy with this app. Makes promises they can\u2019t complete!! Now I\u2019m left with 6 gas miles on my car because I was expecting them to come fill up my tank. \n\nCan I rate this a BUG FAT ZERO!!!!",
      "Hi Albert, unfortunately we are experiencing high levels of orders and could not find a place on our routes for your Charger today. We apologize for any inconvenience. Please let us know if any other days work for you and we will search for a place on our routes. - Rachel\n   Imagine being told this after waiting the whole weekend. From 1:30pm Friday to Monday afternoon following being cancelled once more before. The promotion is either misleading or unsustainable either way it has left my order unfulfilled and my time wasted. (No I didn\u2019t not sit at home the whole time waiting on gas.)",
      "So far I\u2019m disappointed. So I signed up to use the app for gas and I have scheduled an appointment numerous times in north Long Beach, CA and Carson, CA and I continuous keep getting a text that they have a high volume that day. I have tried on different days of the week and the same thing keeps happening. Than the day my appointment is confirmed from 9-2 they wasn\u2019t even in route 10 mins before 2pm and canceled it saying my card declined but there was nothing wrong with that card and didn\u2019t give me a chance to re enter the card information. So far highly disappointed",
      "I have referred 6 or 7 people to use this service. Some have filled so I received my promo others keep getting cancelled on. This week I have tried getting gas with my 50 cent promo 3 times but they say their is no technician near my area. My co worker and I requested service the same day for the next day. She got her gas parked next to me but mine got cancelled because of their bs reasons. This is a waste of time, my cars been low on gas and their customer service rep is no help at all. I will be requesting my money back for the member ship fee. This app is only good for a 2 time use during trial. Don't waste your money on keeping the member ship. Use those 20 and pump gas at your closest gas station.",
      "Dude,\n\nSo my family kept raving and raving about this freaking app mostly cause they were trying to get that 50 cent fill up or whatever. Man, so my first fill up was miraculous to say the least. After canceling 4 days in a row, I guess somebody just accepted my order. Fast forward a week later and my husband needed to fill his car up, I mention them hoping they\u2019d might respond faster, but sure enough. They didn\u2019t! Having canceled literally 4 days in a row again. On the day it finally was scheduled , they texted me saying referral abuse and I\u2019d be charged a delivery fee for services I did not receive. Me and my husband have 2 different cars in the same household. So they cancelled his account.  This by far have been the worst subscription I have ever been signed up for. I will be canceling my account and removing this app immediately! They definitely just lost a customer!",
      "This app is super frustrating when you forgotten your password and tired every thing to contact and reach out to fix the problem.",
      "When I was told about Yoshi I said it was good idea. So I do my membership and Schedule my first fillup...  it never happened. So I decide to do another fillup and again ... it never happened. From there I said I\u2019ll give it three tries. So I book for another fillup, One week ahead for today. I had a alignment appointment for 3 pm. Yoshi asks for a 4 hour window minimum. So I scheduled 9 am - 2 pm.  I got that fabulous text from Yoshi in the morning saying my truck has now been scheduled for today. So you know they have this promotion going on where you use a recommendation code you get your tank for 99c. Who doesn\u2019t want that!? On my time window it said estimated time arrival from 9:30 to 11:30 pm. They were not showing up so my ETA started going higher and higher and higher until it said they were late so I waited one more hour and nothing. So I cancelled told them their UNRELIABLE. Especially booking one week ahead. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS COMPANY. GREAT IDEA BUT HARSH SERVICE.",
      "At first I thought paying a subscription fee for someone to fill my car with gas was a frivolous unnecessary expense. Then I realized many benefits:\n1) no danger having my credit card skimmed at the pump. \n2) no danger of getting mugged or robbed at the gas station. \n3) i don\u2019t have to stand in the blistering summer heat or rain to fill my tank. \n4) I get competitively priced gas!\n\nIn the end I decided those benefits were worth the small monthly fee. Plus I signed up for regular tire pressure readings and my tires stay properly inflated always now.",
      "I tired to get gas every single day of this week and everyday is the same message. \n\n\u201cHi Lyndon Bailey, unfortunately we are experiencing high levels of orders and could not find a place on our routes for your 5 Series today. We apologize for any inconvenience. Please let us know if any other days work for you and we will search for a place on our routes.\u201d \n\nFor 5 days straight 2 different locations",
      "I\u2019m all about saving time especially if it is something that I don\u2019t love doing. The concept of this is great, but the follow through on the company side is seriously\nlacking.  My appointment to have my gas filled up was cancelled without me being notified.  I contacted a customer service person about it & they offered to reschedule to a different day & said they have to do that frequently when their schedules get \u201coverbooked\u201d.   The time I wasted dealing with that & trying to workout rescheduling could have easily been avoided by stopping for my own gas.  Until they have enough people to actually provide a service they claim I will be filling up my own gas tank so I know it is done & completed when I need it.  I am cancelling my membership & will not be returning.",
      "Unfortunately I did not have a good experience with this service. Multiple times they change my service dates which screws up my entire schedule. I am giving them two stars for customer service because they are extremely nice but are extremely disorganized. My car does not sit in one place so I cannot just let them come whenever they feel like it. If you are a office job individual it\u2019s probably a great service for you but for me unfortunately no good",
      "I schedule my gas delivery service 2 days before the day i needed it. They sent me an email saying everything was on track. On the day i was supposed to get my service they send me a text message saying the driver was on its way and a couple of minutes after i got another text message saying my order was cancelled as well as my account due to fraudulent activity. Tried to text \u201cRachel\u201d and she said to send a email, so I did and it\u2019s been 3 days and nobody has written back to me. I don\u2019t think i\u2019ll use their service anymore.",
      "They Cancelled after waiting 5 hours. Can\u2019t reschedule because tomorrow they\u2019re going to do the same thing. Everyday is the same thing. Save your time and go fill up on your own. Relying on these people will have you being late to everything. They need a 4 hour window but never show up or just cancel in the middle of the day. ETA inaccurate. Do you realize how much of a inconvenience that is after waiting hours for a service that never shows up?",
      "They ask for a time window of at least 4 hours when you set an appointment. They failed to fillup my car FOUR times in a row now and I\u2019ve given them a window time of 6 hours everytime. Very unreliable company, they supposedly use mobil gas but sell it for 99c a gallon. You get what you pay for i guess.",
      "I have mixed feelings about Yoshi. I have been using them for 3 months and although the delivery aspect of service is great, they have only been on time about 20% of the time. I fill up twice a week and on those days I\u2019m literally waiting HOURS for my delivery. The most ridiculous one yet was last week. I was scheduled between 9-1pm, I get a text from Rachel @ 5:45pm!!!! You can\u2019t be serious?! They really need to get this on track soon or I will cancel my membership and stop referring their business to my colleagues.",
      "I have tried multiple times to schedule an appointment and every time it is cancelled due to the driver not being able to make the time slot at the last minute. Now today as I have scheduled my delivery for the 4th time they have blocked me out of the application and will not answer any phone calls or questions after attempting to charge my credit card multiple times. Ridiculous!",
      "Terrible! Just terrible! I\u2019ve tried to schedule a gas fill up 3 times. Every attempt, on different days and time frames, has been a fail. Don\u2019t even bothering with a \u201crequested time window\u201d... they never show up. \nCustomer service is equally as bad. \nDo not trust this company!",
      "TERRRRRIBLE SERVICE !!!!!!!!! \nDon\u2019t download \n\nI set a time for 9-1pm on Thursday no show between time window \nSet it up again for FRIDAY ... SAME THING! \nIt\u2019s Monday And I\u2019m still waiting it\u2019s 3pm\nETA ON THE APP is saying 3:50pm\nAnd by the way Rachel is very rude in text messages! \n\nLiterally they will waste your time !",
      "They never come on time make sure you have nothing to do the day you need the gas",
      "If you are referred than you get a 99\u00a2 a gallon fillup, and for every person you refer you get a 50\u00a2 a gallon fillup, so abuse this as much as possible. They are very poor with predicting times and being on time. you are forced to give them a 4 hour window and they still manage to miss that. If you want the 99\u00a2 a gallon fillup feel free to use my code \u2019CALVINT0C5E\u2019. Never pay the actual price or membership, just abuse for a month and delete the app. maybe 2 months if you can refer a lot of people",
      "I just installed the app and thought it was like an Uber for gas, but they are ripping you off charging expensive amounts of services to get you a discount for gas. If you do not use the services they will only charge you for the gas, but then in a month they charge you delivery fees plus to fill-up gas. This app is SO DISORGANIZED which is so unacceptable for the company to do this. If you are reading this DO NOT install. You do not know exactly how many gallons you are filling up which can lead you to be overcharged. The company needs to do better. I would definitely give 0 stars if possible.",
      "The gas wasn't filled up all the way. Didn't offer resolution. Inconsistent service .",
      "First of all, the car wash price went from $35 to unreasonable $49. Car was dirty on the outside, and needed to be washed on !OUTSIDE ONLY! and they asked for more money saying that it took them more than usual 30 minutes, but on a app it\u2019s saying to allow 1 hour! \nThe car is still DIRTY! Customer service never got back to me on this issue, paid $49 for nothing. I should have gone to real car wash for $37 they would leak my car clean inside and out at no additional charge",
      "First of all this service is not 100% reliable which is the most important part if you\u2019re paying $20 a month, the first time I scheduled they didn\u2019t show up. Then they raise the prices on car washes and oil changes by a crazy amount not a reasonable $5 or $10 but $20+. Lastly THEY NO LONGER SERVICE MY AREA or any area around me. Instead of expanding they sent me an email saying they are removing several dozen zipcodes from their service area!!!",
      "The couple of month, pricey but great service. After that, terrible! I\u2019ve been paying $20 a month for sometime now and for what? For them to cancel literally EVERYTIME. It\u2019s not like I live in a remote area! I live in LA. BEWARE!!!!!!!!",
      "Entered 5 ( yes five! ) different addresses and all failed. No service area. I entered my work, my home, my parents home, and then just for giggles my old address in another city and then my address from another city. Nothing. Where do they service? Why did I get the ad then? I live in Fort Worth and I work near Dallas. My old address was in San Antonio. Not like I\u2019m in small cities or towns. So.... what\u2019s up!?",
      "First week with this company went smooth but after that they didn\u2019t show up 3 times straight times and didn\u2019t send a text until the very last minute that they\u2019re not coming. Had to plan my whole day around this and they let me down",
      "Even though this app knows your out of their service range they will still charge you. I really wanted to try this app but it still charged me $9 for something I can\u2019t use and I also got it because it said try it for free?",
      "It\u2019s difficult for me to rate them for service when they keep avoiding me. I reschedule 2 times already and keep saying that they are backed up and the can\u2019t service me in the 4hr window I gave them. But they only ask for a 4hr window so how is that my fault",
      "I downloaded the yoshi and requested for the gas.\nThey didn\u2019t show up and wasted my time since i tried to put a little bit gas instead of full tank since I thought they will show up.\nTheir customer service also are automated system or they copy and paste one answer over and over.\n\nThe worst app that I downloaded from apple store. Not sure apple store trusted Yoshi.",
      "Yoshi don\u2019t have technicians to cover some areas but they scheduled for gas gilling 2 times in last week but unable to fill up gas due to unavailability of technicians in area.\nThey knew they don\u2019t have technicians upfront but they still scheduled it(which is annoying) but unable to perform the services.",
      "You can always get money back but the time I lost believing in this company will never come back. I scheduled my first order since they promised 99 cents per gallon (how can you refuse?) so I requested for them to be here in the morning (9 am to 1 pm). Being this said I stayed at home the whole time and the truck came near my house but never filled up my car\u2019s tank and left. Now I contact customer service (\u201cRachel\u201d) and she says that the car has been filled up using the 99 cents promo on another account so this fill up will be full price and I don\u2019t even have another freaking account! So basically they\u2019re saying I\u2019m crazy. They play with your time, your money and your sanity.",
      "I\u2019ve been using this app for quite some time it was great until I started to give out my referral code to my family so they could enjoy the app service as well. Once I gave it to my brother and he put his car in (mind you we have the same car just different plates) I get a message saying that my account has been closed due to fraudulent activity. I then go to customer service which is only available through text message and ask them if they can give me a reason why my account has been closed and also my brothers no reply. How are they going to blame me of fraudulent activity if they don\u2019t even have their facts straight and the fact that customer service is a complete disaster with Rachel. I need to talk to someone instead of this little kid stuff which I can only text customer service.",
      "Do NOT download this app. They call, text, email, and harass you constantly. I regret downloading it. Not even close to worth it.",
      "I got called by one of the employees and they said they would give me a 20 dollar credit off my fill up but they only took of 10 they lie to you so you can use their service.",
      "The service I receive from Yoshi is life changing, literally. I no longer breath the fumes from gas stations. I\u2019d give it at least a 5+ year adder to my life. If that doesn\u2019t get you going, I\u2019m not sure what would. I\u2019m hooked for (longer-lived) life!",
      "It\u2019s next to impossible to figure out how to change location, for starters. Several other glitches that have convinced me they\u2019re not quite ready for prime time. I don\u2019t hate pumping gas enough to put up with the frustration of the app.",
      "Not cool to receive random call from Yoshi rep to \u201cassist in setting up first appointment.\u201d",
      "No diesel available. Kinda makes this app useless for some people with diesel cars and trucks.",
      "Who ever is on the reviews pretending the service is great they are lying, you are charged 20$/month plus how ever much it cost your gas tank to be filled up. Don\u2019t use this app it\u2019s a scam",
      "Wait until they ask for membership and still have to pay out more",
      "I scheduled a car wash with the fuel visit. \u201cRachel\u201d confirmed the wash visit that morning via text message but they never showed up. When I asked about it, they said I cancelled it in the app...but I never did.",
      "I love Yoshi. They show up at my office every Tuesday and fill up my truck. It\u2019s so convenient and Prices are in line with local stations. \n\nHard to find an issue, so why am I sad? Christmas and Nee Years were both on Tuesdays this year and I had to pump my own gas two weeks in a row. Ugh! Going to a station, checking pump for skimmers, getting the auto fill to keep working, smelling like gas afterwards. \n\nYou may be asking why I didn\u2019t just change my Yoshi day.  I forgot. The service always works without me thinking about it. \n\nI highly endorse Yoshi.",
      "I scheduled an appointment for service 2 days ago. Had confirmation for between 9 am-1 pm... 2 pm hits and no text about anyone in route so I contact customer service (which is only available via text by talking to people under the alias of a Rachel) and I get told that my order was cancelled. I never received an email or text telling me anything. I can\u2019t place a new order because my app still believes my 1st order is still being processed. I ask can \u201cRachel\u201d cancel my order within the app so I can make a new 1. Now all of a sudden I get an \u201cerror completing order\u201d every time I attempt to schedule a new 1. It doesn\u2019t matter what card details I use either. I text \u201cRachel\u201d again asking if I\u2019m being blocked from making a new appointment. Their reply was \u201cNope! So sorry!\u201d ... I have $50 in credit and 4 days left of my free trial that\u2019s about to expire and I haven\u2019t gotten a lick of gas off this app yet",
      "The fact that I\u2019ve been trying to schedule service for over a week and they never came. Rachel (customer service rep) was terrible, she doesn\u2019t communicate with you if the drive is unable to make it to you or running behind and doesn\u2019t nothing to solve the problem other than asking if you want to reschedule only to run into the same situation. How do you expect someone to pay for something and you guys aren\u2019t completing the task!! Thennnn in order to cancel, you have to text her and tell her you want to cancel. What if she doesn\u2019t do it?? You No control only she does. Ohh and my friend also had her card number ran w/o even having the service she requested!! GET IT TOGETHER!",
      "Throw the whole app away. It\u2019s stupid, don\u2019t tell someone they have a free credit of $20 and then when you are referred and signed up, you and the person \u201csupposed\u201d to get a $25 credit BULLSH** \ud83e\udd23 save your time. I almost cursed everyone out dealing with this foolishness.",
      "They cancel my service same day. \nRachel couldn\u2019t even call me , \nShe text me to let me know they couldn\u2019t make it to my appointment. Probably won\u2019t be using appt again...",
      "I only gave this company a one star because that was the only option!! I had a $50 free gas credit but once I put my card on file for whatever reason (being I had a free credit) I received a text message right before they was suppose to come out that my appointment was canceled, wow scam isn\u2019t the word for this so called at your door service!! STAY AWAY PEOPLE IT\u2019S LIES!! EVEN AT GAS STATIONS YOU DON\u2019T HAVE TO DO THESE REQUESTS!!",
      "I see the ads on Facebook and download the app. I open the account and found out that my address is not service yet. If you could not service don\u2019t make people wasting time to open the account with you simply check the location if you can service them then let people open account.",
      "I linked my OnStar account to the app and now it just completely freezes up. I've tried closing the app and reopening AND deleting and re-downloading. I'd love to explore the features on the app but unfortunately it does not work.",
      "Might be great service. I\u2019ll never know because the app crashes constantly and consistently. The whole thing strikes me as half-baked and poorly implemented. Sorry to disagree with the enthusiastic paid reviewers but don\u2019t waste your time.",

      "Used this app to take advantage of the service. I was low on fuel and low on time rushing to get to a flight. I also knew I would be coming home a day later at midnight and would not be excited to stop for gas after a long flight. Ordered gas one day ahead, followed all the instructions, including setting a pin and was all set. \n\nThe day after Yoshi was to deliver gas, I had no confirmation. I reached out to \u201cRachel\u201d via text and was told my ordered had been cancelled via the app. Wasn\u2019t on my end. \n\nEpic Fail!!!",
      "Everyone can make time to go to a gas station, but who the heck wants to go. Bad things happen there. At the gas station I get my hands dirty, buy junk food I don\u2019t need, stand around, and waste time. With Yoshi, I have an extra 20 minutes each week to do things I actually want to do. Can\u2019t wait to get my car wash and oil change next week. Finally, the cherry on top is the service. Being easily reachable, friendly, and understandable goes a long way in my book.",
      "App does not warkwork",
      "I've tried multiple times over the coarse of several days and I'm unable to create an account.",
      "Debug soon.",
      "Good idea and is probably a great service but the customer service side of things is rude and not very informed on the service times the person i spoke with was Rachel I tried to set up gas for a delivery on Monday I received a text from Rachel and was told I could get gas Monday and just needed to add my credit card by noon which I did but some how my delivery was canceled.. contacted Rachel about the situation and she was rude about the situation and that basically tired to make it my fault and said I needed to have my card entered by 9am which is not what she told me so I'm left with no gas which is the whole point of the service.. just sharing my experience",
      "Found this app in my Facebook feed. \nJust went through Setup. First question: \"what's your number?\"  I guess they meant my phone number, but could you be more explicit? And why do they need it? No explanation... Then asked address. Couldn't use my current location although it asked for authorization. The setup screens looks weird too, using non standard widget. Off putting to me.  Looks amateurish.\n\nThen the service: only do a weekly or twice a week, I don't need that much. Also my work parking lot is big and gets busy, so how will they figure out where my car is? Are they going to need me to come down and show them? \nPrice: no mention of delivery or service fee. If there is none they should advertise that because that's the only major problem I have with the concept. Other similar service (with better app) do charge $3, which is about 8% for a fillup. With weekly partial fills, that would raise the cost of there is a fee. \n\nThey need to explain there service much better and hire a designer for their app.",
      "I will never go to a gas station again. Instead, I will use yoshi. There is NO service charge, you don\u2019t have to be there during fill up and its the same price of gas at the local station. Why would anyone ever go to a gas station again?! I\u2019ve had two fill ups and they have gone very smoothly. Save gas and time that is usually wasted by using yoshi.",
      "When I see my tank low on my way to work I can have it filled while there instead of having to stop on my way home. And the price is about the same as it would be at the station."

John from Muvr kept me informed with texts throughout the delivery.  I would definitely use it again.  Thank you.",

      "A friend recommended Muvr, and I'm glad they did! Seamless booking, real-time updates, excellent service, and extreme care make it the best option for stress-free moves. It's easy to use, reliable, and efficient, making the entire moving experience smoother than I could have imagined. As someone who has moved frequently, I can say without a doubt that Muvr is the best option out there. 100% recommended!",
      "This app is absolutely amazing! Can\u2019t wait to see it grow. It\u2019s so convenient for moving and plenty of job opportunities for others in need.",

      "Highly recommend, the movers were very nice, communication was great and the whole process was fast and easy at an affordable price",
      "Rico took my call on a Saturday night and was able to deliver my 2 pc sectional couch the next morning.  They wrapped up both pieces and delivered them inside the home.  Rico even texted me about some scuff marks he had seen before they wrapped it up.  They were good with text and call updates throughout the whole process and their delivery fee was pretty comparable as well.  I would use them again in the future.",
      "Super nice and courteous guys. Amazing service. Timely. Efficient. Polite. Kind. Reasonably priced. Took great care with the furniture that we needed to be moved. We are so happy that another happy customer referred us to Muvr. Will certainly call them first for future moving needs, big or small. And, will certainly refer them to our friends and neighbors.",
      "I worked with the MUVR team to get 8 big furniture pieces from where I bought them, to my house an hour away. Getting a quote was easy, and only 2 hours after my request, the movers were at my door, ready to deliver my shipment. My furniture was carefully wrapped, which prevented damage, and when they were done, the movers unwrapped it and disposed of any trash. The movers were also incredibly kind. A truly white glove service from a hard-working team. The app is so easy to use, too. Will definitely use them again!",
      "Fast, great communication, pleasure to work with. I\u2019ve used them twice now, no complaints.",
      "I was in a store regularly as were these guys. I got their information and had them help me with two separate moves. Both moves were very affordable. They were quick and precise. Took care of the furniture. They are extremely nice and helpful and always have a big smile on their faces. I would highly recommend using them if you have a chance.",
      "I was able to schedule next day delivery with very short notice. Team was very professional and delivered my item in pristine condition and quickly. 10/10 would recommend",
      "Fast and affordable, met them at Crate & Barrel Outlet they saved the day by delivering a couch at a very reasonable price. The store does not deliver so this is a great way to get in-stock bulky items home the same day!",

      "I purchased a tv console from CB and contacted MUVR as I checked out at 3pm. Rico was great to work with and my item was delivered the SAME DAY at 7:30pm. MUVR was a awesome experience.",
      "I recently engaged Muvr to deliver furniture pieces I purchased from Crate & Barrel. Upon calling Muvr to inquire about their availability for delivering the items to my home in LA, I was delighted to learn that they could accommodate the delivery on the same day. The items I purchased at 2 pm were at my home by 7 pm on that very day.\n\nThe Muvr team is not only efficient but also friendly, always wearing smiles. They handle furniture with great care, and their pricing is both reasonable and fair. I was so pleased with their services that I have already booked their moving services for later this month.",
      "I 100% recommend Rico and the Muvr team!  They are quick to respond, professional, polite and very accommodating with delivery times!  They took extra time to wrap pieces to ensure safe delivery of the items, and even offered to remove the wrapping after delivery!  An absolute pleasure to work with!",
      "We recently moved to LA and needed help getting some furniture to our new place. We contacted Jason and he was super professional, responsive, and reliable. As a native New Yorker I've have ALOT of experience dealing with movers and Jason is the best mover I have ever hired. If you're looking for a responsible mover that will get your stuff to you in one piece, Jason is your guy. I 100% recommend him and he has become my go-to guy whenever I need new furniture delivered.",
      "Jason and his team are responsive, easy to communicate with, on time and fairly priced.  We originally used them to deliver a sofa to our home and have since used them to haul away old furniture and with other small moving projects.  We can\u2019t recommend them more highly.",
      "We randomly found Jason, who was recommended by Crate and Barrel to move a sleeper sofa I had bought. He was able to fit us in the following day and happily agreed to deliver to Orange County from LA county.  The communication was great and he was prompt. He was so careful with my walls and stair railing when taking the sofa upstairs to make sure not to damage anything. The best part though was his positivity and personality. We would use them again, over and over.",
      "I have moved almost every year in the past 7 years and can hands down say that this was the smoothest furniture delivery! Very respectful, kind, with phenomenal communication!  I would highly recommend them for your next delivery/move!",

      "I had a wonderful experience! After a little issue with the app, customer service dived in and got me set up with the booking over email. We needed a sofa to be picked up and delivered. Rico was punctual, great to communicate with and the sofa arrived in perfect condition. Would highly recommend!",
      "Muvr helped move a couple of large furniture items from the store to my house. They were easy to communicate with and provide professional and friendly service. Thank you!",
      "Rico (the owner) and his team at Muvrs are literally all-star! You can\u2019t find better. Rico provided me with amazing white glove service every time I worked with him! Between their amazingly competitive pricing (they have so much more value to offer than Dolly or Lugg), and their team-player approach to your needs, I will never use a different moving company! Found them through a referral from a friend, and have already used them twice this week. Both times were custom moves with moving parts, changing addresses and delays, and they were amazingly professional, patient and fun to be around! Jonathan is my favorite mover \u2014 book him! He\u2019s smart & handy! I felt very taken care of throughout the entire process for both bookings (and did I mention the second booking was reserved in less than 12 hours notice and they showed up and did such an amazing job!). Don\u2019t delay or bother to price check them against competitors. You\u2019ll win hand over fist with them everytime. Thanks Rico & Jonathan!! \ud83d\udcaf\u2728",
      "Just recently moved to LA from DC and I can\u2019t recommend them enough. Super friendly and transparent. Spoke to multiple movers who were incredibly rude but these guys made the move extremely comfortable and the experience delightfully. Rico, you\u2019re a star. Get them for any mov you have, the app super user friendly. By far the best.",
      "Had a truly great and seamless experience with the Muvr team \u2014 it was super easy to coordinate with Jason and they helped carry a heavy media cabinet up to the second floor of my apartment building. Super professional and courteous and quick service, can\u2019t recommend enough",
      "Hired them to deliver a large glass cabinet.  They were prompt to respond, completely accommodating, very skilled to maneuver a glass cabinet, and very professional.  They did such a great job that we are planning on using them for an upcoming moving project.  Would completely recommend them!",

      "Had a great first experience using Muvr. Needed a 3 piece sectional sofa delivered from a C&B store in Seal Beach to Valencia and the process could not have been easier. The app was easy to use, pricing was very affordable and the team delivered the item the next day with great care and customer service. Will use this app for future furniture deliveries. Thank you Muvr!",

It was covered, then wrapped arriving and delivered in our kitchen in the same condition it was in as purchased in the Crate and Barrel showroom.  Thanks Jason and crew!  An  A+++ Rating!\nJohn B",

They brought it fast and were very efficient came in got out in record time and had everything set up for me exactly as it should be, if you\u2019re thinking of using them do it!",
      "Fast delivery, great service!! \ud83d\udd25",
      "Found out about this company when purchasing furniture and decided to give it a try along with a few quotes. Rico reached out to me to help discuss pricing options and ultimately ended up being very competitive and I\u2019m thankful for that as they took great care of my furniture along with wrapping protection. Already booking them for another furniture piece coming in soon!!",
      "This is an amazing app and service! I purchased something at Crate and Barrel and immediately downloaded the app and scheduled my pick up. Every store needs to provide the company flyers to offer this service. I now do not feel limited in what I purchase. I know I can just scheduled Muvrs at a click of a button.",
      "App is easy to use and was able to book for a service in less then 24hrs. \nService was impeccable! They were quick, had great communication, arrived on time, and were so kind. There is no other company that beats their prices and great service! Will continue to use them for personal and business  in the future, highly recommend!",
      "Was really impressed by Rico and Johnathan\u2019s customer service. They were always quick to respond and answered all of my questions with a positive attitude. They made me feel comfortable moving a new couch I just bought. I was also really impressed by same day pickup and delivery and thought the app was really helpful. Will definitely be using them again.",
      "Exceptional service from Murv! They made my furniture move to my new home an absolute breeze. The team's efficiency and professionalism were top-notch. I highly recommend Murv for anyone in need of reliable and stress-free moving services. A truly excellent experience!",
      "Very quick same day delivery service!",

I asked to cancel the whole thing and was instead randomly assigned a third partner who is a no show. I\u2019m appalled at the lack of disclosure (open trucks) and inability to Porter to keep their end of the bargain. The porters seem a law unto themselves, the third one went silent after calling to fix up a time with me.",

Again today I just opened the app and I was checking the pricing again I was getting continuous calls even though I asked them to not call me multiple times. Whats the point of having an app when you are running a call centre like service. And how come you are getting the information about what activity I am doing on app. Its so inconvenient and unsafe. I just deleted the app today.",

Also, they handled the items really bad and dragged the refrigerator and washing machine on a concrete road. The items got some dents too during transit and when complained about it to the customer support they were unhelpful and didn\u2019t do anything about it and closed the ticket.\n\nPathetic experience, never use packers and movers service."

I had a great experience overall. As the other driver, \u201cJulio\u201d pulled up, I helped him load the furniture into his vehicle and followed him to the customer\u2019s home. We got there, unloaded and the task was complete. I thanked the customer for her business. Since it\u2019s my first time, Julio assisted me with closing out the job on the app. Thank you Julio! \n\nAgain, great experience overall!",
      "I applied, paid for background check. Everything came back fine then they asked me for truck pictures and documents and I uploaded everything they asked for. Few days later they approved my documents and pictures are still in review and it\u2019s been more then a month now. how many months does it takes a company to review and approve the pictures? What a joke",
      "Be ready to pay $50 for a background check before you can start.",
      "Really easy to connect with costumer and deliver project.",
      "They will not compensate you as a helper if the driver decides to cancel last minute. I could\u2019ve had other jobs scheduled wow.",
      "Unfortunately it seems you can only break even after gas and maintenance. I\u2019m not sure the compensation is adequate or sufficient. I guess we\u2019ll see. Please create a system where we can get cheaper gas or maintenance. Or pay for actual work not just gas.",
      "I accept the job I cross the toll bridge I got on time was waiting for one hour. No respond no getting paid you know time money and I don\u2019t like this kind of work.",
      "I finished signing up yesterday and did my first job today, the app is super simple to navigate and I honestly had fun. Excited for more!",
      "Made me go through the entire process of paying $50 for a background check, registration with drivers license number, social security and vehicle photos and videos just to tell you that you are waitlisted. Total waste of time and money when they could have put me on a sign up list and then invite me back to apply when there is availability.",
      "Easy as 1-2-3",
      "Check to see if you are in their area before entering your personal information. Hope they don\u2019t sell my information.",
      "They have a super long and drawn out onboarding process, and you have to pay for your background. And then after everything, i rarely get any orders i can take \ud83d\ude02. Almost every order i\u2019ve seen was in florida and i see maybe 3-4 orders a day. So i guess its good if you\u2019re in florida.",
      "good",
      "Beware. This app takes months to get set up with. You pay $50 for a background check, it takes weeks for it to clear, and now I\u2019m still waiting for my maintenance inspection to clear. When you email customer support they just say \u201cwe\u2019ll get to it in the order we received it.\u201d",
      "I had high hopes. I got cleared for my background check after paying the $49 by the following day. Then that morning they charged an additional $95 to my card. So I decided I would contact support. It didn\u2019t take long to realize there is no support, I emailed and called with no response. So, I\u2019m unable to make any contact with anyone with the company. Long story short I had to contact my credit card customer service to file a claim against the app for fraudulent charges. It\u2019s seems as though I won\u2019t be working with this company after this mishap.",
      "Well this fuc$& app got real good \u2026 \nI\u2019m from NYC N PAID background check $150 \nExpensive and stupid moved I made \u2026 \nThe worst part is \nI haven\u2019t been accepted\u2026 \nStill reviewing all documents been like this over a month \u2026 PLEASE FOR THE PEOPLE OUT THERE READ FIRST THE REVIEW BEFORE MAKE ANY MOVE WITH THIS KIND OG APPS\u2026",
      "Thank you guys for the opportunity",
      "Id Had my truck dealerships , while in the on boarding process for set up with GoShare! Only   been able to look at jobs came through  the goshare app like take up Lowe\u2019s & many other delivery install  from shopping /depot\u2019s  home deliveries ect. end of today when got my truck out of dealer ship so will see -very Interested in start FT  its middle of holiday season plans for tomorrow . App looks to show some real potential  i cant wait find out tomorrow!   Will follow-up with a  review !",
      "This app/company needs to take a look at its onboarding process. They will expect you to pay $49 for a background check ($150 if you live in NY) as the second step in the onboarding. I can get my own background check done for free that meets all state and federal requirements. \n\nAny company that requires you to pay for your own background check, whether you\u2019re an independent contractor or not, should be approached with caution. It makes no sense to require an out of pocket expense from someone when they don\u2019t even know if they\u2019ll have available projects in their area. \n\nIf you\u2019re looking to make some extra cash, I\u2019d advise not moving forward with this one \u2014 at least not until they waive the background check fee.",
      "I never received any project close to my city. The project that one or two it\u2019s like an hour from my city And the project started 30 minutes after you see them or less I don\u2019t know if this works for somebody in New Jersey. I need help with this apps",
      "They doesn\u2019t care about you , and just waste your time.",
      "App very easy to use even if you aren\u2019t that computer illiterate like me",
      "I got 3 amazing trip request throughout the day today and I wasn\u2019t able to accept any because some drivers receive the notification before others. It should be like DoorDash where only one person gets a request at a time and if that person doesn\u2019t accept it, it goes to another. This app is basically all luck and the pay isn\u2019t that great 70% of the time. Do better GoShare developers.",
      "As far as I can tell from so far I because the gigs are good\u2026.\n\nMy big concern is you will receive a push notification, you tap the notification and there\u2019s no menus in the app that lets you see previous notifications.\n\nI feel like this is an important feature that should be added.\n\nOften times people pick up their phone and tap the notifications without reading in hopes of the app opening and gaining more details of the notification.\n\nUnfortunately, currently, this isn\u2019t the case with GoShare Driver. Just hope you can read the full notification before opening it because you will never see the notification again.",
      "I\u2019m the type of person that uses the same password for everything. I try to log in, it says invalid password. I try to receive an email to change the password, and it never arrives. Horrible design. Do better. A delivery driver of my caliber doesn\u2019t have the time or patience for sub par app programmers. I expect this to be fixed immediately after posting this review.",
      "Love the work flow and layout",
      "If you are a retailer or a driver and you have not started using Goshare, I think you are missing out big time. I have been in Gig delivery, same day delivery last miles delivery, independent contractors for the past 10year . I must tell you that Goshare is the best among all. Goshare has changed my life for good. I want you to  use Goshare for your same day delivery. Highly recommended.",
      "Best courier app Ive had just be prepared for anything.",
      "Amazing",
      "I highly recommend to use this app!!I use this app for 3 years , and I\u2019m very satisfied with the company and the app, very user friendly!",
      "Nice and Easy ++++Aaaa",
      "I\u2019m not seeing this app as great or even good for me. I\u2019m sure there are plenty of drivers that are loving it. But I don\u2019t see it, I\u2019m in Southern California Los Angeles county. Not Los Angeles there is a difference, getting from the valley to Orange County could take 2 hours. That isn\u2019t a exaggeration either. So to go into that part of town for 19 to 35 bucks ain\u2019t worth it. But those are the types of offers I get.",
      "After watching an hour long video and taking a 40 minute quiz, then I was alerted that I had to pay for my own background check, which is $60. No thanks! Should have let me know in the sign up process. I don\u2019t trust any company that isn\u2019t fully transparent! Beware!",
      "Any company requiring you to pay for a chance to work for them is trash. On top of that the amount of fees you can be charged as a driver is ridiculous. I\u2019m glad they make you watch the video first because you can hear it from their mouth.",
      "I recently submit a background check for uber and Lyft, and I think its a biggest company than this company. And I send the background for this 2 company and this company said: your background don\u2019t meet the criteria we accept.  I think this company only need the money for that the cost it\u2019s around 149 and it\u2019s a lot of money to work for a simple app.   I don\u2019t recommend this app.",
      "I just started this a little over a week ago. I constantly see projects available but the start time is within 30 minutes of getting notified and I\u2019m usually 40+ minutes away. So I would be late getting there if I accepted it. I wish you had no less than an hour to get to the location just in case you happen to be over 30 minutes away. I haven\u2019t accepted a single project due to that issue alone. I also assumed there would consistently be projects available, when reality is it\u2019s 1 or 2 every few hours. Which is fine, I just thought there would be more activity. It is a side hustle so I get notified a lot when I'm already at work and barely when I\u2019m actually off. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",
      "This is so far the best app I have used yet I will give it five stars, look forward to doing more business with you, Andre.",
      "I guess I\u2019m so used to Uber giving you projects that or nearest to you. It was very strange to get a project that was an hour and five minutes away from me. I hope that doesn\u2019t happen a lot. I know I have a choice to take it or not, but I don\u2019t even understand why I was offered that project.",
      "Good to go with GoShare. Thanks a lot",
      "I got a request as a helper I accept it I drive 8 miles from my location. I have arrived at the job location waiting for 20 minutes and then they tell me project has been canceled and I text to them. I told them if I cancel project I get paid 50 as fee cancellation and if you were at time of my clock 40 minutes plus gas, I got nothing so I told him the story they tell me they will beat me $10 liar day does not pay me penny they very very happy to charge you $50 cancellation fee but they cannot give you $.50 for one hours west of time I talk to them even the manager he confirmed they will pay $10 for me. I got nothing all play. And I hope if someone see  the views, you know who I am without, thank you",
      "Long application processes only to find out you have to pay for a vehicle inspection and then pay for a background check. I have no idea if this company even has jobs. Why would anyone subject themselves to all of this?",
      "App pays 3-4 days later \nIn 757 area jobs aren\u2019t very consistent \nCancellations result in fee \nIf you complete both sides of a two person job you will not be paid out the respective payment\nAll together you can make a couple hundred on this app but the mile age for the payments as well as the pay schedule not driver support is very supportive.",
      "I\u2019ve been waiting 2 months for my account to be approved so I can drive.",
      "Goshare decided to deactivate my account with a current up to date him North Carolina registration. These are unfair practices, and I will definitely be reporting these practices to the Better Business Bureau. I ended up giving Goshare the documents they asked for, and they still decided to deactivate my account for a few days, making me miss out on potential money.",
      "Keep getting projects updates but it available when trying to check it out please fix just keep notifying on my phone",
      "I have email support multiple times and they send me the same generic email saying to do certain tasks like making sure the Notifications are on , delete and reinstall the App, too many complaints in the Facebook Group about these same issues. Is there anybody that can reach to me for help \u2026 Please a human being not a system generated email would be greatly appreciated. Thank you",
      "This app pretends to take you through an onboarding process. After collecting all of your information it will tell you that you are not in their service area. A simple zip code could have said that. Especially when they ask for that info up front before continuing. But no they want all your info. Lock your credit immediately bc they will run your credit.",
      "Dallas/Fort Worth area courier.\nI would like to tell abit about my personal experience with the GoShare. When I registered there was no orders almost ever, that was especially said because I had to pay $150 for my background check(you have to pay for BC but not everybody pays $150 only those who ever lived in NY). So it\u2019s not a reliable income not even supplement. 2-3 months later business picked up a little, there is one company that sends orders ones a day on the first come first served basis. So I got my first order but when I arrived and waited in line for about 30 min(the whole thing took about an hour) the guy in charge said he doesn\u2019t have my order in the system. Also you are independent contractor so no body will compensate you for time, gas, etc. To summarize \n1. Not enough orders and compensation is not grate to say the least \n2. Long wait time at the pick up location plus you might not even get your order.\n3. Lack of item description usually it\u2019s something like 1-gag mag dag 3pc 46?)8\u2019frtu, that\u2019s your description, I just never know if it is going to fit in my car:)\n3. People at the pick up are poorly organized, to them you just a nuisance.\n4. Orders usually have to be picked up at certain time which means you have to be close which means more unpaid time waiting in the area.\n5. GoShare is not transparent about earnings in specific areas\nBig plus to GoShare support team, they respond really fast. \nI wouldn\u2019t recommend unless you are traveling the same way as the package and you can allocate the time, again this is courier experience(cars/small cars).",
      "It works like a regular company who use apps to make money , yes is true you are you own \u201cboss\u201d I strong recommend it if you guys work with this company to RECORD all your projects \n-Why ? , because is customers who really like to take advance of the system and make a report that you (driver) scratch the walls or the floors to get some credit for the \u201cdamage\u201d , that means they pay less for what supposed to.\nGoShare don\u2019t care about the version you have and they CHARGE YOU the \u201cdamage\u201d . That\u2019s why is required to have a credit card on file when you submit the application to work for then.\nThat\u2019s my story with this guys , they charge me to my credit card for something I never did it and 2 years later COLLECTION company\u2019s star calling me to say I OWN MONEY for a \u201cdamage\u201d project.\nBE CAREFUL !!",
      "I enjoy working with GoShare, pay is great customer service agents are very helpful, quick to respond to issues, will keep in close contact if there\u2019s a problem or cancellation from customers end.They are  Professional and treat drivers with respect.  Use of the app is simple and most customers are professional and helpful.",
      "Went very smooth. Customer was happy and that\u2019s the most important thing.",
      "Had some tires to deliver. It wasn\u2019t far away and didn\u2019t take long. The only thing I would mention is, I took a picture of the invoice, and then I was going to take a picture of the tires, but I hit the wrong button and submitted the one picture of the invoice and it wouldn\u2019t let me go back and submit the pictures of the tires.",
      "Like it",
      "I just signed up for goshare, they deny me because of my background check, my incident happen 16 years(non violent)when I was 19, I\u2019m 35 now. I\u2019m just trying make a honest living and provide for my family. I wish there was a way around this\u2026",
      "When you combine fuel, maintenance, and insurance; so far I\u2019ve delivered for negative income.  Hopefully this is just a trial.  I\u2019m expecting much more work at far higher rates to justify traveling 30 miles from New Orleans to the only customer that I receive requests from.  It has to get better than this.  Let me know what needs to be done to insure a decent wage at the end of the week.  I have faith in the companies potential.",
      "A great way to get an extra income",
      "I was about to write a review saying the only problem was the app don\u2019t let you select more than one job at a time but, soon as I was about to write it another job came thru and I was able to select both jobs lol. Awesome app!!! Just wish they had consistent work thru out the day in my area..",
      "I think this app is a fair opportunity to get out of the house. Take care of people stuff meet new people and have fun. I love it every time I get a GoShare.",
      "Quite a great experience at first time delivery on your platform. Though I enjoyed it, but I enjoyed it more observing customer\u2019s delight to receive their items. Indeed happifying. Thanks for this opportunity.",
      "The app itself is good. GoShare had dropped their rates an increased capacity load. For example a courier vehicle had a capacity of 50pounds. Now it\u2019s 100. Rates were at a jobs paid a minimum of $30 now as low as $19.00",
      "GoShare is joke. I\u2019m renting about their audacity to drop driver\u2019s rate and offer far less paid to their drivers; Yet charging their customers considerably.\n\nThat\u2019s not a fair game GOSHARE! It cost to maintain our equipment as well as operate these vehicles. You ought to do better.",
      "Was great on time",
      "I\u2019m ordering another way that you guys pay out like waiting per week to pay once a week so that the payments can be bundled in the past can be larger so people can pay their bills those payments come out to separate it\u2019s like you\u2019re not making money really",
      "Customer support and availability of customers and jobs is extremely lacking",
      "The gigs pop up but there is a 30 second timer before you can accept it but by the time you wait for the timer to end someone else already accepted the gig",
      "It takes too long to get paid for jobs completed. Get with the times and payout same day like Uber, Lyft, DoorDash etc.",
      "Great app to use !",
      "I signed up as a helper and carrier. I payed $45 for my background check, it\u2019s been a week since my account was activated but there haven\u2019t been any new jobs available. I reached out to GoShare support but only get a response to ensure my alerts are turned on so I can be notified of new jobs. I wouldn\u2019t recommend this app especially when you have to pay, then don\u2019t get any opportunity to make your money back. Stay away from this please.",

      "Don\u2019t try to work for go share it\u2019s not possible. Every time I get a notification for a job I click it, and before it even lets me view the job, someone else has accepted or taken it. Not a good outline for a company, and no regulation on people who are making the hire. For instance I got hired on for truck only, and the guy thought it meant labor and the truck. So they need to figure out when the customer is making the order, to have both options available, driver only, or driver with helper.",
      "Went through the whole process of signing up and spending all the time to get a vehicle inspection and background check just to get signed on and literally see any jobs pop up here. I signed up with the expectation that there would be more than one job that every so often. The jobs that do pop up are way out of your way. Being that I signed up with my pickup truck most of these jobs aren\u2019t worth driving almost an hour to pick up the stuff to deliver it almost another hour away. You spend more gas and if you don\u2019t jump on the jobs quick it\u2019s not even worth it. Thought this would be a great opportunity to make extra money with my truck.",
      "Awesome, easy friendly app.",
      "I have yet to get a job with company\nYou get the notification, then you need to log in, then you have to prove your not an idiot by determining how many bicycles in pictures above .\nGo to your dash board and the gig is gone\nLooks like you have it rigged for a select few\nBruce B",
      "I just started with GoShare this week and what a great week it\u2019s been!  I just retired from 3 decades of teaching and needed to stay productive and useful. I have had several great delivery experiences thus week.  Customers are so grateful for my help and the feeling of helping is very fulfilling.  GoShare is so easy to work with and for. Customer service is very responsive and very helpful. Payments have been quick and estimated job payments have been accurate.  The only challenge is beating out the competition for jobs, since it\u2019s first-come, first-serve. Got to be quick, responding to notifications!  What an excellent system too!  Using a smart phone, an app, and my truck to make money.  My Apple Watch is also a very useful part of the technology. Thanks GoShare for providing these opportunities, for helping me make money and serve others, and for helping customers with their needs. It\u2019s a Win, Win for All!!  Sincerely, Alan G.",
      "I started working with GoShare a week ago,  thanks to my family friend, that told me about this app. I had my truck park at the house while I was doing Uber on my SUV. I couldn\u2019t believe how busy and professional this app runs. So far I did 6 trips. And the only thing I can say, is that I\u2019m very happy with this app. The Dispatch are totally awesome and very helpful. Now I drive my truck all day lol.",
      "Rarely any jobs pop up and when they do they\u2019re gone when I try to accept",
      "GoShare is the best company I have worked for by far. I have been with them since October 2020. They pay better than any delivery company I have worked for. The dispatchers are awesome and the customers are generous tippers. Most projects can be handled by one person. Buying a truck was the best decision I made in my life. It\u2019s worth the investment since people always need someone to deliver their furnitures. GoShare is growing and expanding. One day, it will be the most popular and well known platform ever. Just do your part and be smart. Show up on time and communicate with the dispatchers. I\u2019m planning to stay with GoShare as long as they exist. A+",
      "Very easy to use simple money making platform. Love it!",
      "Super excited to work for a company that looks out for their drivers.",
      "So far, I\u2019ve found GoShare to be a pretty good way to lose money and time. The orders are so sparse, I can\u2019t make any plan or schedule and the few orders I do get are so far away from my starting point, I lose money in time and fuel just getting to the pickup location. If you accept a helper job and there\u2019s no main driver, they will reschedule the pickup for a different time, even though you just spent an hour driving to the location. If you accept a job and have to reschedule for bad weather, they charge you a $20 fee. It could be a good way to earn money. It just isn\u2019t.",
      "Very few decent opportunities and this app charges if you need to cancel a project within seconds of accepting it.",
      "Go share is the best platforms by far you get paid for your mileage also tips from customers plus if you have a small sedan vehicle you can still join the platform as a helper or courier and make great money just be sure when you accept a job you be on time and if a emergency comes up be sure to reach out to customer service and explain your situation don\u2019t matter what\u2019s the situation at hand if not you will hit with a no show fee so longs you being responsible you shouldn\u2019t have any problems with making great money I been with go share over a year now and I love it!!",
      "If you actually want to have piece of mind of receiving a payout without slick emails demanding repayment for things you didn\u2019t do, find a different company like Roadie or Dispatch. You\u2019re better off running your own LLC than being a courier with these clowns.",
      "the best app good money here\ud83d\ude0d",
      "I\u2019ve been a driver for 3 months and have only been \u201clucky\u201d enough to secure two jobs. Why you ask, because the app does not work. When you get a new job request, it gives you 40 seconds to review it. After the 40 seconds you hit \u201caccept job\u201d and it says sorry someone has taken this job. Horrible process! When you contact customer service they say. You probably have an old phone or it\u2019s outdated. Both are false, I have the newest iPhone and it\u2019s fully updated. I would love to hear what the developer is going to say about this!",
      "Hey , this is a great company to make some extra cash with and meet great people . It\u2019s a little more then what I thought at first . But , that\u2019s because I was waiting for the punchline . My mistake . It\u2019s as good as it says it is . Now to why I didn\u2019t give 5 . It\u2019s more my fault I think . Customer service is very thorough and on top of making sure the customer is getting a professional and on time driver. They make sure all is good . Just a tad impersonal when it\u2019s comes to their drivers at least in my case . But , In the end it all turned out well . $$$$$ so no 5 stars til I get more work lol .",
      "Generally it doesn\u2019t worth it ! First, the app and the way you receive a jobs are totally Stone Age process. It doesn\u2019t match with your current location!!! You may receive a job which is 50 miles away from you. Secondly, it depends what cellphone (iPhone or Android ) you use. Because any time you want to accept the job, even though you pick up the past and do it quickly, it will says job is claimed with another guy. I called customer service and they said it is about the system and the type of phone that you have . Junk !",
      "Easy to use, easy to earn.",
      "They won\u2019t let you sign up if your vehicle is older than 2006 regardless of whether it\u2019s in excellent condition. My truck is 2002 F150 4x4 with 5.8L v8 which can haul 8,000 lbs normally with a limit of 13,000 lbs per the manual.",

That\u2019s a cost of doing business that should fall on the company, definitely not the contractor. No other app or company has ever asked me to pay for a background fee. \n- They charge a cancellation fee to drivers ranging from $10-50. How ridiculous. Their video tries to explain how it is not a punishment but there\u2019s no going around it. Your parent/spouse/child suddenly in the hospital? Pay up. You get in a car accident? Pay up. \n- To move on with the onboarding process you half to watch a HALF HOUR LONG video that explains nothing but common sense, and about 7 minutes explaining the clumsy flow of this app. AND THEN you have to answer a 41, forty one, question quiz on the video. It\u2019s easier to sign up to deliver people (which doesn\u2019t say anything good about uber or Lyft either \ud83d\ude02)\n\nThere\u2019s better apps and services to use. I will not be recommending this company to customers or other gig economists.",

Example I saw a job that the customer wants you to pick up something from their house, take it to a warehouse and then return another item back to the customers home. That is 2 jobs!

And the price you see, that\u2019s not what you get, if it\u2019s a store like home goods \n$10 of your pay goes too them and 20% to GoShare.

In the last 3 days I haven\u2019t been able to get but 1 project. For some reason I am not getting requests to my app. I only receive emails which I reply with the word \u201caccept\u201d, but most times, nothing happens. I deleted the app and downloaded it again and it is the same thing. I borrowed a friends phone and downloaded the app on his phone and I was able then, through her phone, to accept the 1 job I have been able to do. I triple checked and my phone have push notifications activated. I don\u2019t know what seems to be the problem, and I have only been able to communicate via text messages with your support team. \nJust right now I received an email with a project but nothing on the app! This is very frustrating! As of right now, I am in the negative with GoShare. I haven\u2019t been able to even recuperate the cost of the background check. I will really appreciate some technical support with this app. I have friends that have trucks and were all waiting to see what was my experience, to see if it was worth it before they move forward or pay the background check. As of right now, my experience has been very frustrating and disappointing. Please, I need some technical support. Thanks in advance.",
      "Great experience",
      "I have been driving for the company for approximately two years. Though I love the extra money and the work and fully support the program, I am now unable to responsibly accept any new jobs. \n\nFor over a year, my app has stopped displaying the date/time for jobs. I just recently found out (from the customer service) that I am not the only one with this issue. My previous work-around was quickly swapping to my email to check the date/time of the job, but the company recently updated their email format and removed the date/time. \n\nNow, I have no way of accepting a job without blindly hoping that I will be available. As a military member, I cannot simply up and leave my day job on a whim, so I carefully select which jobs I accept. \n\nI would love to continue to do this work, but I\u2019m at a stand-still and can\u2019t participate until this glitch is resolved.\n\nI have reached out to customer service no less than three times over the years; only on the most recent attempt did they admit that the problem expanded beyond me alone.\n\nFor the record and tech support purposes I\u2019m on an iPhone 7 Plus with the latest iOS installed.",

Sometimes, some payments will be added together without indicating what project it was by adding project numbers, which makes it very difficult for me as a driver to track my payment as they are paid out to me. Some payments will be paid alone, sometimes payments will be paid randomly by picking one from the top and leave like 2 in the middle unpaid and one will also be paid from the bottom and this makes me lose track of my payments as a driver. This payment method is not transparent and it\u2019s a very bad style because sometimes some of my payments are never even paid.

      "I\u2019m very disappointed in GoShare\n\nAfter providing excellent service for multiple hours and ensuring customer was completely happy, I was only paid less than 2/3 of what I should\u2019ve been paid on one of the most difficult projects I\u2019ve ever done.\n\nI reached out to GoShare multiple times and no one seemed to care and was just told to give it a few days. After 10 days I reached out again and was then told that the payment would remain the same.\n\nA driver shouldn\u2019t have to deal with the deception of being told to give it a few days and It shouldn\u2019t take this much effort just to finally get such an unfair and disappointing response.",

      "GoShare purposely will not disclose historical contracts for your area so that drivers are not incentivized to register. Our city is a complete waste of effort unless you desire to waste more money on fuel than what you would earn per gig. Don\u2019t waste your time with this app!",
      "Notification comes and jobs are instantly gone before they can be seen, People getting a head start to obtain the job is worthless to anyone else. Only one I was able to see was 22 dollar Tire delivery and 40 miles of driving.",

Are there drivers with counters less than the 30 sec? How do I really get these projects that seems that always are taken by drivers with less seconds in their counter? How can I lower the time in my counter to be on the same fare situation? Thank you. Gerardo",
      "I signed up two months ago and still have seen an offer that worth my time.  I accepted one helper offer and when arrived the location at Costco, the customer said that no need for helper, the cargo van driver can do both jobs.  I contacted the GoShare support, they contacted the customer and said the customer canceled the helper offer but I will be paid $15 since I came back the location. A month later, I haven\u2019t receive the $15 payment and I didn\u2019t bother. No offers available in my town though I saw several offers where the drop off is in my town.  The pickup location is 17 miles and the total pay is about $24, total of 34 miles; not with it my time.",

Received the request, accepted it, got to the job early no one at the Lowes pickup point had any idea where the cargo was, the control number given on the app did not work, the customers phone number given was disconnected, and customer services ultimately canceled the job after being here for 30 minutes! Huge waste of time, the load board needs to better vet their customers for drivers so as to not waste their time!!!!",
      "They only care about there bottom end. Had an accident happen on the way to a customer and service to get the situation under control was horrible. Then they made my rating like 5151 ranking so I don\u2019t even see projects anymore.",

If you have weak cell service forget about it\n\nThey don\u2019t have same day pay like most apps ( this is a big deal especially considering they get the money from their vendors usually the same day or the day after \n\nThey charge you for canceling even if it\u2019s within 10 minutes of selecting a job and you accidentally accepted it and it\u2019s like 20-30 dollars\n\nIf you get cancelled on they paid you a fee which is really nothing at times and they don\u2019t show it in your earnings. Which can throw off your accounting \n\nYou never know how much money they owe you. They simply show you how much you\u2019ve already been paid. All the while all the jobs will show as paid. It\u2019s very confusing.",

If you do any of that your charged $50 automatically without consenting but the likelihood of you getting reimbursed for your time due to a client or app mistake is not likely. \n\nPlus the customer service reps can be rude even in a moment or crisis. If you apply stay on top of your application status because it takes awhile then all of a sudden you\u2019ll get a bunch of responses from different people asking for additional information. Stick with the main support/ driver email and not individuals.\n\nPS\u2026 I don\u2019t I remember receiving any tips.

We are all here to make money but how can I if a job is gone as soon as I click on it. It\u2019s so disrespectful to all the drivers . One time I was in the store when a order came in and guess what I could not get it this also makes no sense. Frist come frist works in a grocery store at a deli counter not on deliveries",

You have to pay a $45 fee to get a background check and If you accidentally accept a request or no longer can do a request even if it\u2019s 24 hours or more before cancelling they charge you a $20 cancellation fee every time you cancel even if someone else picks up the request for you.

GoShare should NOT allow more drivers to sign up in areas where they know it isn\u2019t busy. I wanted to get my money back for the background check and a representative said I couldn\u2019t. I just think it\u2019s really messed up to advertise $30-40/hr when in reality it is nothing because there\u2019s no work.",

They make you acknowledge accept many things..first drivers can not be late for pickup if it\u2019s more than 15minutes late and if the customer complain they keep track of it, after you make $$in thousands few months later they would take money from your credit card without your authorization because you already authorized them on the credit card before. I think only thieves would do that. They have only ladies handling the accounting department and those ladies have no mercy they are rude, they don\u2019t talk to you\u2026they charge your credit card for penalty for showing up and e-mail you the receipt for the amount took. If the driver cancel the pickup for some reason and becomes more than their limit they charge you penalty and take money \u2026they have only chat window sometimes nobody would respond for hours\u2026no one will talk to you one on one when you are in need, if they need to talk to you they will and they expect you to answer the phone., that is slavery. Basically they treat drivers like trash. Sometimes they have long haul deliveries for solar companies, they pay only one way tolls and they don\u2019t pay tolls for you coming home if it\u2019s longer than 8hr drive they don\u2019t pay for hotel stay, they expect you drive back immediately or don\u2019t care if you drive immediately\u2026.that makes 16hrs of driving which is not allowed. All other apps like this give Deadhead ($ per mile) to comeback home after drop off. This GoShare doesn\u2019t give you a penny not even tolls to come back\u2026instead they take money from your credit card without your authorization\u2026.be careful of this scams.",

When a job notification pops up (2x a day or less) it\u2019s usually booked by the time you open the app. The jobs available are typically low pay and during normal business hour, far outside the city, making it unrealistic as a side gig. I spent $750 on new tires because the first inspection said my tread was too low, 55 for the inspection, then another $50 on the background check. I feel duped.",

There is nothing wrong with outsourcing your delivery vans. But these yahoos do not want anyone who doesn\u2019t have their own van. I don\u2019t have to have my own personal insurance on the cargo vans that I rent. That is covered by the company. It is unfortunate that we were not able to work with this company but considering the absolute hypocrisy of saying use the cargo van. And they don\u2019t want to hire you. It\u2019s obvious from my standpoint that this is most likely fraudulent company. I will not ever ever use the service. For my own deliveries to be made or vice versa. And I will tell all my drivers to not use the service. It is unfortunate but I would strongly recommend Apple remove this service from their platform. Delivery drivers should be allowed the option to outsource their delivery vans and rent them if need be without having to provide all kinds of proof. I do all the background checks on my drivers. Do not use this service stay away it is obvious they are only wanting to rip people off. I cannot abide by fraudulent companies saying one thing and then doing a complete 180 on another. In business you have to be honest and forthcoming and you cannot be discriminatory on who you hire. I recommend the federal government checking in on this as well. It\u2019s a real shame good concept too bad it\u2019s run by a bunch of fraudulent scammers.",

For me to drive into Manhattan and and drive across the GW bridge with toll is $16 and it would take me a minimum of one hour w traffic. Then to drive to Union would be another 1.5 hours.

I have mentioned this over 2 MONTHS to the front end staff team and they say they alert management. Hopefully management will look at this Review.  I really like PF except for this issue.",

Can someone answer me how yo approach this dilemma?\nI enjoyed my intro at the Everett fascility on evergreen. I need to sign up before December. Thanks. Wendy",
      "Please add FaceID login, or at least set up the email field to automatically prompt my email address via autofill. It\u2019s very frustrating to have to manually type in my email address when I walk into the gym. Both very easy features to implement (I\u2019m an iOS developer)",

      "Everything this app DOES have seems to be working well. It always loads quickly, is easy to navigate, and can track WHEN I work out and the TYPE of workout I do. However, I wish I could track my actual workouts so I can see the numbers change as I get stronger and more fit. I\u2019m trying to lose 50 lbs and would love to see the differences from start to finish, know the total number of pounds lifted to reach my goal, and refer to past workouts so I make sure I\u2019m progressing. I don\u2019t want to carry around a book, and the app I used for years has really gone downhill and freezes all the time.",

      "Planet Fitness is convenient and has several different types of equipment. I wish they had more open floor space to workout. The area in the front and back with the dumbbells can be crowded at times.",
      "The app could be much more useful than just a check-in tool. \n\nThey have a \"fitness journey\" record so that you can record how many seconds you've run on the treadmill, as well as qr code linked videos to show you how to use the machines. \n\nI just wish they would have though to add some data entry for those QR codes so that I can scan a machine and record the weight and reps setting and not have to go with a third party app. \n\nHaving that data would probably be a benefit to the company as well, since they could be more informed when ordering new equipment.",
      "I really appreciate PF making memberships affordable and this app has cool features",

I don\u2019t want to spend the time each day at the gym trying to find a favorite workout. Another ap allows me to filter what I am focusing on and then suggests a month of balanced, but progressively more difficult workouts.  Planet fitness has better workouts, if the app could support them.",

Love the videos!!  They\u2019ve been a game changer for me.",

      "I signed a contract with Silver Scripts which is a government program for Seniors! After I heard about how they allow men in the showers with young women ( a photo was in social media showing a 12 year old girl sitting on a bench in the women\u2019s dressing room with only a towel rapped around her) while a man and trust me you can tell it\u2019s a male is standing next to her!! A woman asked him to leave the dressing room and he refused because he said I now identify as a woman! And so she took the photo and went to the manager and asked them to please remove the man because there is a child in a towel!! They told the woman she was out of line and she was thrown out and her membership canceled! So when I saw the photo and heard about the situation as a former teacher and having a degree in Childhood development my first inclination is of course always to protect children-ALWAYS!! So my husband and I only pay extra for the \u201c black area since silver script pays for our gym membership!! \n   So next my husband called our bank to cancel our Black card membership and I called silver script to make sure they wouldn\u2019t continue to pay and they informed me I didn\u2019t even need to let them know or the gym because if we don\u2019t attend they don\u2019t pay the gym!! \n  So we thought we did our due diligence!! Next thing I know my husband says he looks at one of his credit cards and Planet Fitness is taking payments from his credit card! So I call and I am very upset!! So come to find out when the guy , Jon,  finally told me not only did the have our bank account we gave them to pay the \u201cBlack area \u201cthey  somehow got another of my credit cards? I was livid because they got that card when I purchased something at the gym. \n   So to sum it all up. I went down to the gym because now according to the manager , \u201c Jess\nAka Jessica , we should have been told to come in person to cancel the membership ( although that still isn\u2019t always 100% but be careful because they are shady!) they can do it over the phone it just depends on who you talk to and when. But Jess wanted to make a point and she was arguing with me there was no original but I remember signing a piece of paper and what they handed me certainly was not what I had originally signed and in fact you can\u2019t even read the silver script government ID numbers because when they cut and pasted they covered over it!   \n    I asked for my original contract I signed and they told me no such thing! Everything is inside their computer. So here\u2019s what they handed me and this is why you should never use your debit, credit or even sign up for planet fitness: they handed me a contract  with two bank accounts, a debit card, my government account-\u201c  silver script number and finally a final credit card. So in total they had four different credit accounts to draw from. And they had written down three different dates with my signatures. Now if I was going to give them my credit I would do it all at the same time!!! And what was even worse they put\n \u201c staff  Initial \u201c just the word no persons initial !!! Because no real person saw me write it or witnessed it!! \n    My son in law actually does contracts for Banks and corporations. I\u2019m going to be sending him the contract they gave me. You can even tell on the first page it looks like it was cut and pasted! \n    So you know how you hear there\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch!! When they say it\u2019s only $10 a month DON\u2019T  GO  THERE!! DON\u2019T SIGN ANYTHING!! DON \u2018T TAKE YOU\u2019RE CHILDREN BECAUSE THEY DON\u2019T care as ABOUT CHILDREN EITHER! DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS THEY SAY ITS FREE FOR CHILDREN BUT LOOK AT WHO ELSE SHOWS UP AND HANGS OUT IN THE DRESSING ROOMS!!! \n   So protect yourselves and your children!! \nRESEARCH GYMS. IF YOU HAVE TO PAY EXTRA BUT THEY ARE HONEST THEN ITS WORTH IT! Don\u2019t ever use your cards there because they somehow got access to two bank accounts a debit and a credit card and they had access to my government account!!",

I did notice that they only have 1 leg press (free weight) at each location which isn\u2019t convenient. One thing that does bother me is the perks. I signed up for the black card to get the PERKS and I couldn\u2019t claim my free Apple Music. I called the gym and they couldn\u2019t help or direct me either.

      "I have been using the PF located on Telshore in Las Cruces, NM 5 days a week for the past 7 months. In general, I  have been satisfied with the service overall . However, lately I have noticed a decline in the upkeep of the facility. Lately, a number of pieces of equipment (at least 7) have gone months without being repaired. I find it hard to understand why spare replacement parts aren\u2019t stocked. Additionally, at least 4 of the TV monitors have been frozen for the past 4 weeks. Two weeks ago I asked the manager specifically about tv monitor #4, since it\u2019s set on CNN, which I like to watch and listen to with my earphones while on the treadmill. He stated that he would look into it but 2 weeks later, the streaming link is still broken. I don\u2019t understand why a different working  tv monitor can\u2019t be tuned in to CNN while the connection problem is investigated and fixed. I hope someone will look into the issues in the Telshore location and take action to resolve them. Thank you in advance for your attention to this matter.",

      "The prescott location allows their employees or at least a particular employee, Ben (roughly 5'4\" on a good day, has a \"We the people\" tattoo on his forearm as if he stands for anything like that. This short, white,  buzz cut \"man\" proceeded to shout from across his counter, \"You're so and so right?!? Yeah! you're an *sshole, you called me and all my coworkers racist, you're an *sshole!\" Ben proceeded  the front desk counter and having to be physically restrained by a female employee who was clearly restraining him with her own physical body to prevent further escalation from planet fitness's employee at prescott, az, BEN. BEN continued to not follow his employee conduct that he agreed to when working on the clock as a planet fitness employee, in uniform, without his name tag on. How convenient for ben huh? He decides hes gonna swear at me, double down on his lies about something i never had said and take even further by annoucing it to all his co workers anf members passing by. Not only sharing, but lying about it all in the process, slandering my reputation and my conduct with his false public statements. Thankfully not the manager but another employee seen what BEN was doing  and actually follows their guidelines which i think goes without saying is never to use profanity and conduct yourself in a threatening, egregious, abhorrent   manner the way BEN was doing on 9/10 , from moment i scanned in 11:15 til when I left after my business was done with my workout. The GM at this location, Randy will permit and allow employees like BEN, to break protocol when he sees it suffice. Rules are black and white, not grey. This Planet fitness management will state to you its against their policies to record anything they say because they do not want anything as far as employement termination coming back to them. They will state they do not see such evidence in their camera recordings and will disregard any evidence that is plain and clear to see to cover their own security over actually following their employee conduct handbook and standing up for their members against disrespectful employees like BEN. BEN was permitted to swear at me , call me *sshole multiple times, get so unprofessional that other co workers step in between himself and the pathway towards me to prevent him from getting physical altercation with me. If you tell them how to improve their gym in confidential member survey, this location in particular will allow employees like Ben to swear at members, misquote them in a slandering , threatening way for all to hear in the gym,  and for managers like Randy to permit it and vouch for their employees disrespecful, egregious, threatening, conduct towards members they feel like discriminating against like myself not just cause or reason.",

      "There has been the problem with some of the PF locations not offering training classes due to the staff failing to hire trainers although they advertise that they offer them for members which is included as part of their membership. However members are aware that they are paying for this service out of their monthly fees and/or from the annual fees they\u2019re being charged for at the location where they signed up. Apparently, it has been weeks, if not months with no available fitness coaches throughout the  LA locations. Who do we report this to? Perhaps the district managers? It just seems that they are not seeking or hiring them out of due diligence and rather letting this part of the job slip. Also their app lets you schedule the appointment times with the opening slots even though there are no trainers available for those times at all. Goodness, that is misleading. The staff are aware of this issue yet they don\u2019t seem to take this up to the corporate. If they did the it should\u2019ve been somewhat fixed by now. However if you don\u2019t have coaches at your locations, let the members be aware of it by posting signs at the gym so they know the current update. We\u2019d love to see those classes to become available with what they\u2019re claiming on the PF website!",

I recently purchased a membership to my local Planet Fitness and was very nervous about starting the process of strengthening my core and several other areas that I have had some issues with over the last several years. The app offers a lot of excellent ideas for low impact strength training that I have been researching from home and attempting to perform at the gym, and I\u2019m starting to get my confidence back. \n\nI highly recommend Planet fitness, even if I only spend a half hour to an hour in the gym at this point, it is a step in the right direction.

I think there should be a filter for yoga/pilates and you should be able to save it as a favorite so you can go back to it. I shouldn\u2019t have to search through everything all over to try and find it. I don\u2019t know if any of the locations actually have classes you can join for yoga or Pilates, but my location does not, so the app video is the only method I have available for this particular class. Please include this option on the app to save favorites and a separate filter for yoga and Pilates. This app so far is average, but it could be much better.",

From the friendly staff at the front desk to the doable 30 minute classes, which everyone can fit in their busy schedule; you guys have thought of everything! I\u2019ve only been a member for two weeks, but find myself super excited to go. I also appreciate being able to bring a buddy to work out with me as part of the black card membership and, the massage chairs and beds are phenomenal.

      "Something weird going on here, I signed up like 5 years ago but got in a wreck and stopped going. Kept the membership because I thought I might go back but it\u2019s just never happened. So I ended up closing the bank account I used to pay them. Then I got badgered for like 3 months that my billing info need updated, yada yada, hadn\u2019t been there in over 500 days. Well, somehow they got the information of a card I activated like a week ago through an entirely different bank and charged me for past and current months. I call them and ask how they got this number and some stoner kid was on there saying they require two forms of payment at sign up, so that must be how they got it. I was like how did you get a card that I just activated last week, 5 years ago when I opened the account? \u201cUhhhhhhhhh here call abc PFHealth,\u201d didn\u2019t even know the number just like I was supposed to know who that is. All right gym but there customer service and billing is a nightmare and a half. Not worth it.",

      "Some member need to be considerate of their time in areas and using the equipments as others pay and therefore should be able to use areas too. \n\nI wanted to use bench and a member had his phone on the bench while using a machine and claimed he was using the bench. \n\nI think the employees should monitor how long persons are on the machines.",
      "Nice to know that if I can't make it to the gym I can do these workouts at home",
      "You would think that Planet Fitness would want to make it easier for you to simply check-in, like developing an app for the Apple Watch. Also, there is no NFC support. All locations require you to scan a barcode. Snap Fitness is better in security because they require an NFC card to get in the gym. I was hoping that Planet Fitness would have something like that, perhaps allowing us to add a digital wallet card to the Apple Wallet. This app is useless otherwise. It\u2019s bloated with deals that you can get anywhere without this app.",
      "I love planet fitness. The way the customer service here is truly some of the best. I love it how everyone is very non-judgmental",

      "I joined Planet Fitness when my daughter\u2019s father joined so we could go as a family, he could help with our daughter etc. Unfortunately, I became paralyzed due to a serious staph infection inside my spine that spread to my bloodstream, bone, heart & brain.  Needless to say, I was hospitalized for months prior to being transferred to a rehabilitation facility learning how to sit, stand, walk, take care of my daughter, etc.  I had called the club asking about canceling my membership, but was told I had to come inside the club to do so.  I explained that I was not only paralyzed, but I\u2019m hospitalized & have no idea when I\u2019ll be discharged, let alone be released ny doctos to go to the club.  Informed them they can easily check and see that I\u2019ve never once been able to go to the facility.  Eventually I was discharged from the rehabilitation center & learned how to walk with the assistance of a cane and went to planet fitness to cancel my membership, however I wasn\u2019t able to do so since it was during the midnight shift and needed to come back during the day.  I\u2019ve been in and out of the hospital ever since due to a weakened immune system, haven\u2019t been able to return since.  Meanwhile Planet Fitness has definitely made sure to withdraw the $25.05 every single month for almost 2 years now. They make it so easy to join to their gym online without any issues, but it\u2019s absolutely impossible to cancel without going in personally! Just something to think about, nobody plans on traumatic injuries or accidents happening causing the inability to drive, walk or be hospitalized for months, but Planet Fitness definitely takes advantage of people when those situations happen, and I\u2019m still to this day having to pay for a membership that I\u2019m not able to take advantage due to health problems and this has been ongoing for 2 entire years now!!!  Just something to consider if you plan on joining their facility online. I used to be personal trainer and as a music Dj created Zumba tracks for several fitness centers across the country prior to health issues. Thankfully I still remain in contact with about 90% of my clients so I\u2019ve definitely been able to share my experience & problems with Planet Fitness. I may only have about 10,000 followers, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s probably made some type of impact on their new memberships in the Chicagoland area.",
      "There have been persistent issues with my membership with planet fitness that went unresolved, the most recent being a billing issue where planet fitness returned the money that I had in my account to pay for my membership for no apparent reason. Following this an employee in the store asked me to leave and said I wasn\u2019t allowed in the gym. I showed him the transaction history that shows that I paid for my membership and was still exited from the building. I had to resolve the issue on my own, without the help of customer service or support from PF representatives before my membership was reinstated, but now have no intention of continuing any fitness regimen I previously had in place or was planning on implementing with them in the future because of this harrowing experience. Truly this was a nightmare to wake up to.",
      "More advanced 10-20 min ab core workouts please. I\u2019m getting no results when I filter.",
      "Thanks",
      "Hidden fees, packed gyms, purposeful difficulty in canceling your membership\u2026 just pay more outright to get a better experience elsewhere. Not worth it.",
      "Not everybody wants to carry their phone around especially in the gym. That\u2019s why the Apple Watch is so successful.\n\nAre you guys aware of how important it is to support the Apple Watch? \n\nI\u2019m going to cancel my membership because of this and give my money to a gym that doesn\u2019t require my cellphone to be in the facility.",
      "Cheap and they\u2019re everywhere however it\u2019s not for real bodybuilders or anyone who lifts more than 75 dumbbell or 100 barbell. No bench press or squat racks either. But for the price and 24 hours, it\u2019s a good gym",
      "The only value in the app for the user is to send guest passes, if you have a Black card.\n\nThe crowd meter is inaccurate or slow to update. I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s based on historical data vs real time data.\n\nNot sure how they got around app badging without controls in iOS. The notification is only marketing messages within the app.\n\nIf you\u2019re connected to the gym\u2019s WiFi, the app doesn\u2019t work or at least it doesn\u2019t at the location where I workout.\n\nI wish it would just default to my QR code for check in.",
      "I haven\u2019t tested out everything else on the app; I do my own workout and I\u2019m sure there are MANY amazing tools for people and the crowd meter is just one tiny thing compared to the vast ways this app can benefit your workout, HOWEVER: I think it\u2019s a big deal since I bet EVERYONE looks at it and regardless of how a person works out, NO ONE likes working out in a gym that\u2019s too crowded; that\u2019s universal and I WOULD be using this feature all the time if it were actually accurate.\n\nThe crowd meter on the app is deceptive and stupid. I was there the other day with two bars and it was pretty busy. I had to wait to use some equipment, and at that point I checked again and it had 3 bars. It never filled in more bars than that though. So by this logic 4 bars should be maxed out; or 5 bars MAYBE if there are like, lines to use everything! Why would it go up to TEN BARS and make us think it isn\u2019t busy! The fact that PF tries to make it LOOK like it isn\u2019t very busy renders the whole thing useless and deceptive. \n\nI thought it was a neat feature that I\u2019d use a lot when I signed up, but now I see it\u2019s only a marketing ploy and PF is a lot busier than anyone would ever want. You should be truthful about it and 3 bars should really be around 7. Or change it to 5 bars being the max. Either way, the way it\u2019s set up now with 10 bars and only having it at 2-3 all week long is misleading and pointless.",
      "I have felt very welcomed the past week going to the gym and everything is just right at planet fitness!",
      "Some of us don\u2019t want to lug our phones to the gym. Do better.",
      "It would be nice if there was a feature that would allow people to queue up for the massage chairs so if there is a line you can know what order you are in",
      "One day the app will work fine but then a day or two later the app just decides it doesn\u2019t want to let me check in or anything and sometimes it doesn\u2019t even say it has my membership there.",
      "These exercises are great for tight shoulder blades",
      "The main use of this app is the QR code to check in. Why they don\u2019t make it open onto your code I\u2019ll never understand.            You also can\u2019t cancel from app. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re going to get sued by the FTC for that soon.",
      "The old meter used to be a lot better. The gym will be 90 percent full and the bar is on level one. Like come on.",

I left workout anytime to come here since the lady up front at workout anytime was very rude to me and wouldn\u2019t allow me to bring my daughter with me to workout. People want to go someone where they feel wanted , not somewhere where they feel like they aren\u2019t welcome and told your back again , like what does it matter if someone comes back when their a member and haven\u2019t done anything wrong. I could understand if I damaged something or did something but none of that have I done at workout anytime I have felt more welcome at Planet fitness then workout anytime. All I had to do yesterday was call planet fitness and the guy up front told me I was welcome to come with my daughter. The only suggestion I have for planet  fitness is on the app putting a place for pictures to be took inside the app. To keep track of your progress. Other then that I have enjoyed it at planet fitness and was thankful to the staff who aloud me to be a guest before I joined!",

As a trainer he is respectful, upbeat and kind. Do try the PF gym, you will enjoy it.",

But, it would be great if there was a way to keep track of weight and reps for a particular machine for weight lifting. So you can keep track of your progress as you get stronger. Even if just for your own strength journey rather than for activity tracking. Just a thought. But, still a great app.",

      "I\u2019ll have to say this is a pretty straightforward app. As a blind person, I am able to follow the instructors on the app. I am pretty familiar with the exercises because I have a history of being in the gym. This is great for those who may not be able to make it to Planet Fitness on any particular day and want some sort of effective workout at home. there are many levels and different types of workouts to choose from. yoga, weights, exercises without weights, etc. I was surprised I must say. as a former gym rat, I didn\u2019t like some of PF\u2019s in-gym policies in the beginning, but where I am now, I just accept the rules and go towards getting healthier. choose your battles.   I would recommend especially for beginners.",

      "I absolutely love this app that makes you feel empowered. I love being able to just learn about any piece of equipment without setting up time with a trainer. I love the home work outs to pick anything I want. My only complaint is I have a fire stick in home tv and it the workouts freeze when doing the Bluetooth to tv. I\u2019m gonna try an Apple TV to se if that helps.",
      "Great App for a beginner. Would love it there was a \u201ccheck out\u201d function so that the crowd meter was more accurate. \nWould love a workout builder. With options to select machines, weights, and reps. Something to reference and check off while at the gym.",
      "Always great! Very accommodating!",
      "Don\u2019t join if you ever think you have to cancel because it\u2019s more challenging than it\u2019s worth to join. Join some other gym with reasonable cancellation policies",

      "The crowd meter is never accurate. I hate it, I go specifically so I won\u2019t have to wait for one machine for 30 minutes. It\u2019s never accurate so what\u2019s the point of it.",
      "Worth having. I wonder why planet fitness won\u2019t allow one to change their assigned gym location? Seems like an easy function to add. Otherwise a fine app, with too much stuff to list, perhaps most impressive is the excercise routines and the collection of membership discounts. Also the \u201ccrowd meter\u201d for the gym is pretty cool.",
      "Love it",
      "I used to be able to leave my phone in the car and use my watch to check in. That was very convenient so I don\u2019t have to carry my phone in. I know there are lockers but I dont need to use them.",

It's great to see something so well-made and accessible to everyone.\n\nSuggestion for Future Update:\n\nIt would be fantastic if they added a widget that displayed the weather and activity at my local club. It would be very useful to know what's going on there before leaving home.",

I noticed that I had another $49 fee about a month after I signed up. This is an annual fee. Maybe I didn\u2019t read the fine print, but why would I be charged another $49 less than two months after joining? IMHO the sign up should include the year fee. I feel I just wasted $145 for I won\u2019t be refunded the annual fee. So, I believe sign up should include all fees and yearly fees be charged one year after joining. There shouldn\u2019t be a blanket charge each July/August. Had I joined in September I wouldn\u2019t have had this annual fee until the next summer. I\u2019d have canceled by then.

      "I strongly advise against choosing this health club chain. They have extremely underhanded business practices and very poorly kept facilities. I had so many, many issues with them in the clubs that I went to in the few years that I did use them.  And I had used three different clubs in the area since I do local traveling.  It wasn\u2019t just an issue with one bad club; they are all like this.  All three had issues.  \n\nThe list is long - freezing cold men\u2019s locker room in one, nonworking showers in all of them regularly, people leaving weights everywhere and not cleaning up after themselves because no one makes them, tvs not working, cardio equipment not working, one played Spanish music all the time (literal Spanish singing, like we were south of the border), another played LOUD ghetto rap all the time, inadequate amount of equipment for the amount of members (regularly had to wait for equipment, dragging your workout much longer than it should be), VERY limited range of equipment (none have a bench press machine, nor a squat rack!), and that\u2019s just the stuff off the top of my head.\n\nAfter I moved, there was no planet fitness near me.  Plus, my college had a MUCH better gym that I could use for free. I had no locked in commitment to them, just a monthly agreement that I could cancel at anytime.  But, as soon as I did try to cancel, they had a ton of hoops for me to jump through. They required me to go to the original gym. I signed up at. That gym was now hours away from me, so that was completely unfeasible. the other gyms refused to let me cancel, though, and used the excuse that I had to go to that one, like they didn\u2019t all have me in the system!  Just a scam to try to get you stuck with them by giving you a huge inconvenience if you move.\n\nThe other option was to send a written letter requesting to cancel. I did this, and with tracking no less to confirm they got it.  They STILL claimed they never got my letter, even though I had confirmation from the tracking that they did!!!\n\nThese illegitimate and literally illegal excuses to try to keep you locked into a non-binding contract. Even though I haven\u2019t used their facility in nearly a year now, they still try to act like I\u2019m supposed to be paying them monthly!!! Fortunately, no collections agencies will accept their debts, because they all know they are illegitimate and can\u2019t actually collect on them legally.\n\nAnyway, it\u2019s not worth saving the money. There are multiple other options you can use where yes, you will pay a little bit more, but you will have much better equipment, a much better kept facility, and if you move or have something else come up where you need to cancel, they aren\u2019t going do something as underhanded as this company does try to keep you locked into something that you were never locked into to begin with. Look around the Internet, everyone else has the same exact issues. They are reputation is absolutely horrible because of it. I strongly, strongly advise you go somewhere else, or if you have already signed up and that\u2019s why you have the app, I suggest you go to the gym you signed up at and cancel immediately while you still can.",

They will call you none stop and continue to charge you be cause You have to to go in person to the planet fitness that you signed up for to cancel.  They don\u2019t really tell you this and it should be said in bold before you sign\nUp because it\u2019s very inconvenient. They need to change that immediately",

For sometime who is only going to be in this town for three months this is a lot of money, I went 70 dollar sign up fee, plus two 10 dollar a month fees, 90 dollars. That makes sense when other gym memberships are 30 dollars a month. But 140 dollars for the summer? Not worth it.",

      "I\u2019m staying in Virginia for the week and the local planet fitness tried to charge me 20$ for a day pass I was extremely surprised because the facility wasn\u2019t even all that, another gym down the street let me workout a day for free and charged 10$ a day for an EXTREMELY better facility. I don\u2019t blame the staff working for planet fitnesses prices, but 20$ made me mad enough to write a negative review.",
      "Following an embarrassingly unpleasant experience at Planet Fitness, Aramingo Avenue, Philadelphia, I strongly advise against visiting or joining this gym. \nI visited Planet Fitness in my quest for a well equipped, accessible gym in the area and after finding it a suitable place decided to join it. But minutes later the manager attitude left no room for me to come back to the gym again. \nAfter making my mind to join the gym, I took permission from the staff on the front desk for a short video of the place. I thought I will encourage my acquaintance as well to join and show them how well equipped it was. As soon as I started making video with my mobile, a visibly angry woman appeared ordering me to stop filming. I turned off the camera and explained that I did it with permission from the front desk. She, however, said that she is the manager and asked me if I would stop the video or would prefer to be expelled. I told her that I already turned off the camera and that I expect her to say the same thing gently but she grew angrier asking me how did I enter the gym. Since she was making me feel very awkward, I came back to the front desk staff to explain that I was using camera after getting her permission but that lady there was behaving very rough. While I said this, the manager arrived and angrily asked me why I was speaking there again. To avoid the increasingly embarrassing situation, I left the gym feeling more like I had an encounter with a gangster rather than a gym manager. \nMy sincere advice for new gym aspirants is don\u2019t visit or join this gym if you don\u2019t want to be treated by unprofessional and arrogant staff. Every person deserves respect.",
      "Typical gym membership scam. They force you to jump through all sorts of hurdles to cancel your membership. There\u2019s no way to cancel through the app. No way to get a real person on the phone. You need a specific manager to meet you at the gym. Meaning going back several times to make the appointment. I should have listened to all the bad reviews.",
      "My experience with the Planet Fitness app has been disappointing. I have repeatedly been charged a late fee of $15 because I am not notified before my due balance expires. Additionally, the app only allows for a one-time payment option, rather than enabling auto-pay for monthly dues. It seems that Planet Fitness prioritizes charging late fees rather than collecting regular payments on time. This approach seems shortsighted and not a smart business practice. Sadly, I have decided to cancel my membership due to this behavior. I feel misled and dissatisfied.",
      "The app\u2019s cool when it wants to work. I signed up for the summer pass, tried linking my membership, didn\u2019t work. Not too sure what to do now or how to fix this.",

      "I have been trying to cancel my membership for months now. I moved away and don\u2019t have a planet fitness near me so I decided to cancel my membership. I have called and left multiple voicemails as well as filled out their contact forms online and I have heard back from no one. Contacted them on instagram and they said they couldn\u2019t do anything and I had to contact the gym I signed up with. I have tried to contact them and no one will answer. How can I cancel when I\u2019m being ignored? Seriously the worst business.",
      "I\u2019ve been a member of Planet Fitness for years. When PF decided to empower guys with gender dysphoria to change in women\u2019s bathroom I had an epiphany. I could no longer in good conscience be a member. What about the victimization of young girls being stuck in a bathroom with a confused mentally ill male adult?! Outrageously wrong and PF saw no problem with it. \n\nI hope more people cancel for the same reason.",
      "I like the gym although I think that they are judging \u201clunks\u201d even though they say they are a no judgment zone but I digress - app is awful, there is a way to track \u201cgym activities\u201d but nothing lines up with the actual equipment they have in order to be able to come up with a work out and track the weights and reps to monitor improvement.",
      "When signing app for membership i was told i had to do it thru the app despite me being at the gym itself physicly(which was a very seamless process, thumbs up to that). Time goes by and i had to move to another state, and ofcos i forgot i had to cancel my gym membership before i moved. So now i\u2019m in another state and try to cancel membership thru the app only to be directed to contact my club.

Great Hydro beds and massage chairs obviously my favorite thing the gym offers the massage bed. Clean bathroom,  customer service is average, staff not too friendly definitely not outgoing to my standard but not rude or non responsive either. One employee an overnight employee definitely brings customer service down to a near bad review and was nearly tempted to put the place on a a negative social media blast as I felt, I was being targeted as someone by an employee who does not like me and I felt as if he did not appreciate my service as as a customer , and his customer service was very poor, and I felt like he was agitated by me every time I was around and wanted something like a drink or lay in the tanning bed or whatever.

I should have double checked, but as there are many tasks assigned with moving I clearly put a bit much too faith in the support I would receive and that someone in a moving company might suggest that this is not then appropriate vehicle. I had to go and rent a U-Haul van to and make separate arrangements.

      "A horrible experience. When the first helper arrived, he informed us that he had not heard from the second helper after trying to reach him all day. He suggested we contact Dolly support to either cancel the move or see if they could send someone else. I attempted to call Dolly support 3 times without being able to speak with a human and opted in for a callback which was never received. Eventually we learned that the second helper was \u201c30 minutes away\u201d which turned into 90 minutes. My move was very time sensitive so myself and my injured family member were pressured into helping move items down the three flights of winding stairs which is why I hired moving help in the first place. Canceling this move was not an option. Because we could not move the large items without the second helper we spent over an hour just moving boxes closer to the truck which would then be moved into the truck later. The mover asked my family member to help him move a couch, knowing my family member had a back injury. When the second helper arrived almost two hours late, he was often on his phone and inexplicably left at one point for 15 minutes to move his car when my street had free parking. I hired a different moving company to unload, and when they opened the truck they were baffled at how poorly and inefficiently it was loaded. At least a dozen of my items were damaged, including an expensive coffee table I need to replace. When I did finally reach customer support, I did not have the option of speaking to a representative by phone but had to email. They informed me they do not cover damage to items for labor only blocks, so beware you could accrue hundreds or thousands of dollars in damage and Dolly doesn\u2019t care. The second moving company recommended I ask for a refund based on how poorly this job was done and said if they had done this poorly they would offer a refund. Nick who I was emailing with from support was very unhelpful and unconcerned by how poor my entire experience went, and didn\u2019t even acknowledge that my injured family member was asked to help move a couch by Dolly after we informed then he had a back injury. They also did not issue a refund and took days to get back to me after my first attempt at contacting them. Please stay far away from this company.",

He let me know what I could expect, where he was in the delivery process, and was at my home when he said he would be. He and his helper carried the sofa in making very sure they did not scuff my door or walls. Bryan is so kind and if and when I need assistance again I will not hesitate to call and request him. Thank you Bryan.",
      "What a fantastic effort trying to get this piece of furniture up my too narrow stairs. I appreciate all the hard work these guys have put in today.",
      "If I could leave more than 5 stars I would! We have a very large, solid wood, 8 seater dining room table and Johnson and Steven moved it with NO PROBLEM! Very appreciative of their help.",
      "Dare I say, easier than requesting an Uber! we tried a similar app first, but it kept stalling out on the map. we googled and found Dolly, and after a super quick sign up, this app worked flawlessly.  Our helper Phillip was super friendly and communicative too- which made the washer dryer move from Costco to the house go smoothly.",
      "I bought a heavy patio set through a Facebook site around dinner time. Downloaded the Dolly App and was able to get 2 movers and a truck within 30 minutes! They were professional, kind, and efficient! Love this app.",
      "Jeff and Matthew took care of my move in the very best way! I had the world's best movers. They were cheerful, careful, thoughtful, and really strong. I cannot recommend more highly.",
      "They need a better system. Five days nd they could not deliver something local. They did not have a helper , five days in a row . What kind if service is that.",
      "Unreliable. My Dolly got relisted about a month before my scheduled move, and luckily for me another helper picked it up for the exact same day and time within an hour of the cancellation. However, my Dolly was relisted again at 5:30 AM the morning of my scheduled move. Ended up needing to go with another moving company. Stay away.",
      "Just had an absolutely awful experience with Dolly. I scheduled movers through Dolly 5 weeks in advance. They canceled on me 2 hours before my scheduled move time. Dolly didn\u2019t notify me, email or text to let me know my movers had canceled. It was a truly awful experience & I ended up having to spend way more on task rabbit for same day moving help and do most of the move myself. Dolly offered no financial compensation for all the last minute expenses I had to incur because their movers decided to cancel last minute. All the customer service person would say was \u201cwell the movers had to pay a cancellation fee to Dolly!\u201d Well good for Dolly I\u2019m so relieved to hear you are profiting off leaving me in the lurch!!!\n\n Moving is not the same as calling an Uber for a ride somewhere, Dolly should be prepared to help customers in this situation because there is no flexibility with lease end dates. This gig economy business model Dolly has created for moving clearly does not work. I will never use Dolly again.",
      "Do not and I mean DO NOT USE DOLLY. I paid for same day delivery and what happened? I waited ALL DAY AND NIGHT, I had to call almost every hour up until 9pm only to be told \u201cNo helper was available.\u201d Same day delivery was $100.00, not a big deal as I \u201cWanted it on the same day.\u201d Big Lots recommended DOLLY.\n\nIf same day delivery is not available on same day WHY OFFER IT? \n\nNext day, I call to \u201cCheck if a helper was available?\u201d Same excuse, \u201cNo helper is available or has responded.\u201d I canceled my order, made sure I received an email confirmation that it was canceled. I went back to Big Lots and sales guy apologized and then told me other customers were less than satisfied also. Then why does your store patronize DOLLY?\n\nBottom line bad experience, DOLLY representatives all had horrible English, had to explain my frustration and complaints multiple times to different representatives.\n\nEnded up renting a Uhaul truck, lost a day of work and delivered ourselves. \n\nSave yourself the headache, rent a Uhaul or a friend with a pickup and rest them for gas or lunch, at least you\u2019ll know the date and time of your delivery because you\u2019ve done it yourself.\n\nI WILL NEVER EVER RECOMMEND DOLLY and I plan on reposting to the Better Business Bureau. Anyone who wants to use DOLLY check other reviews on DOLLY and Better Business Bureau websites.",
      "Calvin was great and helpful!",
      "Booked a move thru dolly and got a helper confirmed. I had a 2 hour window for them to show up, and 10 minutes before the end of the window the email me saying the helper had canceled and they couldn\u2019t find anyone else to do the job.\n\nCoordinated my whole move around this since it was confirmed in writing. There is no customer service number, only an email and AI chat bot that doesn\u2019t understand basic inquiries. \n\nEnded up booking with taskrabbit and had someone respond right away, and the job costs less by 50% thru taskrabbit.",
      "Robert was AMAZING to work with! He was prompt, efficient, professional, kind and super strong! I greatly appreciated his help; couldn\u2019t have moved the heavy table without him! Thank you Robert & Dolly! \ud83e\udd17",
      "This company is the absolute worst. Terell was amazing and was a life saver but Dolly as a company I wouldn\u2019t recommend to my worse enemy. I wasted a day off to be given a fake apology and no type of help when my original delivery time was not kept by this company. After agreeing to the following day they still called me the next day and tried to reschedule my time again. But thank God Terell was at the furniture store where I ordered from and agreed to deliver my furniture. In the near future I would not go through this company they don\u2019t care about customers!!!! Thank God for employees like Terell who care and even though he had nothing to do with the situation at least his apology fault genuine! But Dolly you seriously need to train your customer service team on how to treat customers point blank period. Every person I talked to on the phone did nothing but make the situation worse.",
      "Most dollies I used are excellent. Only thing is that if price cut down a little then I would use you more. Worth five stars still.",
      "When the app works, it works great. But your helper can cancel within 1 hour of your move and cause a lot of inconvenience.",
      "Great service but the prices fluctuate and change all the time so keep that in mind. I used the service once and I was happy with everything and the flat rate!",
      "Manuel was on time and worked hard. He went above and beyond and are grateful for his help.",
      "I had an armoire on the second floor in my bedroom and needed. It moved to the first floor. It had six drawers and a mirror. It was extremely heavy and I wasn\u2019t able to move it down by myself.\n\nMiguel and Manuel came and moved it without a problem. They were so very kind and respectful and had it done in no time\n\nI would use my Dolly for everything.!",
      "I\u2019m not one to leave reviews, good or bad.\nTerrible experience. Driver asked me to help to take in something heavy. \nHad no choice but to help.\n\nHad about 50 fifty feet to go once in the door,\nSaid he could not come any further and dropped it there.\n\nHe then took a pic of it real quick and then of the apartment address, and scurried put in a hurry. \nMust be nice to make 200 clams for that.\nNever again.",
      "Horrible and very unreliable! Have a move scheduled - day off of work, elevators booked in advance at apartment buildings in busy city - TOMORROW morning. Scheduled a Dolly over two weeks ago & was assigned a Helper. Just got notice less than 24 hours before that the Helper canceled. You can only contact support via email, so there\u2019s no way for me to get help quickly. Going to have to cancel entirely & pray I can find someone on Task Rabbit. Moving is stressful enough, I don\u2019t need movers canceling on me last minute. Do NOT recommend.",
      "They had no one booked the day of my move. I scrambled to find help. Would never use again. Zero stars (but I had to select one to post)",
      "Great service I have used in the past - this time helper has been MIA since booking 2 weeks in advance. Moving in 24 hrs and no communication.",
      "The process of getting my very heavy new furniture delivered to my third-story condo in Midtown Atlanta was completely hassle-free from the moment that Ronald L was assigned the task. Ronald and Andre B are both big, strong men, they had a great attitude, they were totally professional and cooperative, and they brought all their own equipment. I have literally never had a better furniture delivery experience.",
      "I booked a move for 8 boxes and a mirror. I was moving things from storage & my boxes were out out of the storage and ready. So he ended up moving 5 boxes only. He really didn\u2019t have to do much because I helped him a lot. I called customer service for a price adjustment. They said they couldn\u2019t change it because items wasn\u2019t ready. They don\u2019t know it was minimal moving & I helped him. I didn\u2019t make a fuss about it but I did end up spending $100 for him to move 5 boxes full of clothing \u2026 \ud83d\ude43",
      "Tried this as it was recommended by a friend. \n\nVery easy app to use, terrible implementation and terrible customer service. \n\nSet up to move a pullout couch. \n1st one got cancelled but then rescheduled with a new helper. The 2nd time the helper didn\u2019t show up so it too got cancelled. \n\nThen customer service called me to tell me that they had to cancel and if I wanted to rebook I would have to do it myself. \n\nI said thank you but no thanks. I now have to find another way to move the couch.",
      "The drivers rescheduled my Dolly w/o consulting me. The drivers were not prepared for the task at hand. The Dolly did eventually end up going well. The flaw was that I assumed the drivers would ask questions or verify the order. I\u2019ve used Dolly before w/o incident. I know now to be very specific in instructions",
      "I tell everyone I know..",
      "I have used dolly for many moves. This last move is the only move I had issues with it; therefore, I am giving them a 2 rather than a 1.\n\nI selected a 2-bed apartment move for the whole apartment plus a refrigerator. Dolly called out that you could utilize this option for up to a 1300 sq ft apartment. Ours was 800 sq ft. The largest truck that was offered was a box truck. Assuming Dolly knew what they were doing, I thought this was enough space to fit everything.\n\nIt was not. Luckily, the helpers were able to take the big things (couch, dressers, entertainment center, desks, and large boxes). We had to take 3 trips with our car to get the rest of the items. \n\nI took a look at what is offered for a 3-bedroom option and it is also a box truck. If you have a lot of bigger furniture and boxes,  I recommend going with a different moving company.",
      "I had my service canceled twice, so I found another option. Dolly relies on the availability of freelance movers\u2014like Uber or Lyft\u2014so they may at times be hard to find.\n\nOn the positive side, a customer care rep reached out to reschedule both times.",
      "I have been fortunate enough to have found Dolly and have used their services five times in the last three weeks to move everything from a desk to a huge refrigerator and each time I am delighted by how innovative and interactive the app is but more important than that, just how EXCELLENT their people are.\n\nNot sure how Dolly weeds out the wrong people from the ones that are devoted to providing extra good service with a smile and with professionalism and expertise, but I am grateful.\n\nThank you for putting a smile on my face now and for future moves.",
      "They were on time and efficient. Super kind! Great job. Thanks for all the help!",
      "Anival and his team did a spectacular job moving my things. They were fast and efficient and very friendly and courteous. Everything arrived I perfect condition and arrived 2 hours ahead of schedule.  Thank you Anival!  I will be sure to tell my friends about you and Dolly",
      "Oscar and his crew did such a great job and were so fast, efficient, and careful with all of our items. We had to make a stop at a storage unit first and then to our final destination and they were able to accommodate and get it done quickly. This was my second time using Dolly for a move, and both times it has been smooth sailing. Highly recommend.",
      "I scheduled my move a month in advance and \u201chelpers\u201d kept getting assigned to my move and then dropping. 3 days before my move there still wasn\u2019t a helper assigned so I called customer service (which is based outside of the US). I asked the customer service woman if a mover would be assigned before my scheduled move and she just kept repeating herself \u201cyes, no worries someone will be assigned before the scheduled time. Don\u2019t worry\u201d. After she said that multiple times, I asked her if it was a guarantee and she switched up and said \u201coh unfortunately it\u2019s not a guarantee. But if that happens you can call us that day for a refund.\u201d So - there was a reason to worry and a refund wasn\u2019t going to help me move in time. My move out day comes, and still no one was assigned. I ended up having to come out of pocket and rent a moving truck and pay random people I found online to help me move. It wasn\u2019t until the end of the day on my scheduled move that a customer service agent called me to tell me \u201cunfortunately we weren\u2019t able to find anyone to move you today\u201d \u2026.obviously. I looked up Dolly on Yelp and they have multiple accounts on Yelp for different cities - all under 2-star reviews. Thank god I found a last minute alternative solution or I would of been charged by my leasing company for staying past my move out date. If I haven\u2019t made it clear - I DO NOT recommend this company.",
      "Had to move at a moments notice and the heroes showed up",
      "Daniel is very present, communicative & customer service oriented. His helper was very attentive and followed instructions well. Daniel anticipated me needs and had a positive attitude. This was my first experience with Dolly and it won\u2019t be my last! Thank you very much!",
      "Dolly canceled my move and did not refund my money.  Buyer beware. The communication is terrible from the company.  Alex, the assigned mover, was a great communicator but the Dolly platform is not good.",
      "This my second time using Dolly. I used them two years ago for a mattress and today for a sofa and each time was perfect. The movers took directions well , polite and quick.",
      "Super friendly and helpful. He and his assistant were very fast moving the couch out of my basement \u2026very careful of not hitting any walls while moving. \nCommunication was awesome! \nHe was on time and I am very pleased. Would definitely use Dolly or Daniel\u2018s help again.",
      "Wonderful! Everything was great the entire process!",
      "I\u2019ve been trying to get a delivery since last Monday and you have canceled on me 15 times. Yes that\u2019s correct 15 times.!!!!!!",
      "I scheduled same day help around 9am from Dolly, requesting 2 helpers between 2pm and 4pm. By 3:50, Dolly never assigned any helpers, so I contacted Dolly and they told me to extend out to 8pm. So I extended to 8pm and by 7pm Dolly called me to state there will be no available helpers to help me move\u2026 incredibly inconvenient!",
      "Brandon and Daniel were the best. They were on-time and took care of my move in under 1 hour. They made a stressful day much easier.",
      "My relative had to cancel out moving my mother\u2019s arm chair & chest, to assisted living. Thank goodness Dolly was able to arrange a helper with a truck the night before.  Got them moved, no problem! The helper, Cornelius was on time, courteous and made the move quickly. He brought another guy with him to help, which came in handy. The items were heavy. Many Thanks!",
      "I\u2019m strictly trying to enter my information and get onboard as a helper somehow I keep getting sent in circles",
      "Highly recommend!!!!",
      "I was excited to try this out and the price quoted was very reasonable. 1 bedroom apartment move with a box truck for $507. However, Dolly wasn\u2019t able to pair me with a helper. I ended up hiring two people off task rabbit and getting my own U-Haul for 1/2 the price. When they say 99% of people are matched with a helper I\u2019m guessing it doesn\u2019t factor people who cancelled because they couldn\u2019t find help. Nobody is waiting until day of their appointment to get screwed over.",
      "Bought an elliptical machine at Sam\u2019s club and this app helped me get it home the same day.  Bought on line at 8 am, by noon my dolly helper was assigned and by 230 we were home.  Communication with helper was seamless.  I could see where he was on the map.  Everything we needed to know about each other was pushed into my notifications and eliminated any guessing.\nMy helper was stellar, Michael.  He was strong, and friendly.  Helped as if he were putting it into his own home.  I appreciated his service.",
      "These guys did a great job. I am very pleased. I would book them again.",
      "Best experience ever.  Jum was the best.",
      "The app is great and I have had very good customer service from the helpers!",
      "I don\u2019t use 3rd party services for any reason, but when I found a deal on a clearance sofa for my new apartment, I sacrificed and was expecting the worse. Luckily, Yunaisy and her helper from Dolly were quick and careful with my item and it was delivered without incident. Thank you !!!",
      "I have to be honest here, I am fighting an eviction process, I have a good case for a appeal, not being served correctly. \n\nI also have all of the rent owed stashed away in escrow because it was a bad error on their behalf, not a lack of funds. So after I was thrown out of my apartment, I had to leave all of my stuff in there, and I am now homeless. Today was the day that I got access to my stuff one last time. My grandmother came through and offered me some of what little money she had left in order for me to hire movers to help me out with the furniture I had left. We are not given a ton of time to accomplish this and after some back and forth between attorneys, I had just today to do it. \n\nI have AIDS, so I am not really strong enough to do this kind of work, and I literally risk dying to do it. Hiring Dolly, I don\u2019t have any choice but to trust that they are competitive. I requested the Dolly help hours before I needed it, but nobody accepted it. I pushed it back as far as I could go, and I got a call from someone who wanted me to pay more money when they arrived, to come and help. I didn\u2019t have any money to spare, so he didn\u2019t accept. He offered to do it for the amount I paid in cash, if I cancelled it - but I knew that I would not be refunded for the service in time. I understand why he would do that but it felt like a bait and switch. \n\nNobody accepted, and I was stranded. I lost everything I owned, because I know that the attorney will not accept my request to come back. I am so distraught about this. If I had the strength to do it myself I would. Maybe they don\u2019t pay the people enough. I don\u2019t know. \n\nIt\u2019s not Dolly\u2019s fault that I lost everything, but I am incredibly disappointed in how badly the expectations are set in the app, how they take $600 dollars out of your pocket to \u201chold\u201d your reservation with no guarantee that your going to be able to get help. And if you are limited on resources, your money is held up by the hold on your card and you can\u2019t even pivot to something else. \n\nI have had only positive experiences with the competition - \u201cLugg,\u201d so I am sad that I trusted Dolly this time. I liked the flat rate fee, even though it was higher than Lugg, but it made no difference because I was burned. Beware, you do not want to use them for big moves. Use Lugg instead. I don\u2019t have the choice anymore.",
      "Thanks to J. Muhammed and his helper!",
      "Two movers come to move one desk from the main floor to our basement office. I asked them to take the desk around the side of the house because it was a tight turn at the bottom of the steps. They thought they knew better. I heard a big crash. I went to see what happened. I have a hole in my drywall that is about 2\u2018 x 2\u2018. I reached out to Dolly to file a claim and they said sorry we don\u2019t cover damages to your home only the item being moved.  Will never use or recommend them again. Thanks Harold C. (My dolly mover that damaged the wall and said he would come back and fix it but ghosted me.)",
      "First time use and very satisfied",
      "We had set up two helpers with dolly for a move. At 9:30 pm the night before the guy messages me that they\u2019ll be an hour and a half behind schedule and then asked me to switch the time forward so they could arrive sooner. This was all so they could cancel without repercussion. Dolly left us high and dry for our move, don\u2019t trust them. They will let you down and leave you without help.",
      "The guys that delivered my furniture was awesome. Dolly charged me twice for the services and I am not happy. They were not cheap.",
      "Ascencion and Gilbert are very hard working professionals who made my move very easy from the beginning. Great communication and attention to detail. Would recommend 10/10!",
      "Johnson and Trey were so great!  Treated our things with care and super nice to work with. Will certainly use Dolly again.",
      "My Dolly was Marquis and he was awesome! There was a miscommunication with my booking on my behalf. I scheduled for loading only and he still took the time to unload my stuff. He was very busy that day and still made sure my job was 100% completed!!!",
      "After describing my item to be picked up, it was accepted. They were late to arrive and then determined the item (which is a China cabinet in two pieces) was too big for them to move. THEY cancelled the job, and then charged me a cancellation fee on top of what was paid. It has been escalated, but the day after, still no response. My opinion is this is fraudulent and may lead to legal action. Again, I don\u2019t recommend this company.",
      "Used twice now\u2014they are very good. No more asking friends to use their pickup!",
      "Helpers never showed and couldn\u2019t get a refund. $200 down the drain",
      "i would find a private helper , very unreliable , 2nd attempt in trying to book someone, they never can find anyone.  Then you have a hold on your credit card it\u2019s really a joke.  Find someone on your own.",
      "Jose and his helper was great! Made quick work of moving our \u201cafter-moving in-it-won\u2019t-all-fit-boxes\u201d from our apartment to our garage. Will definitely use again!",
      "I didn\u2019t know this service existed, so it was my first time using the app. It was exactly what I needed with no problems. Thanks!!",
      "Hate long reviews so here is the best I can do of a summation.\n1st time: It was perfect.\n2nd time: One helper was late leaving the other having done most of the work.\n3rd time: The helper contacted me at 6am to confirm 10-1030 window to not show up. I attempted several times to contact the helper with no response. \n\nNow Dolly wants to change me a cancellation fee for their helpers lack of professionalism for doing what exactly I do not know. \n\nStating that window was 10-11am. Yes it was initially, however the helper changed and confirmed the time he was coming more than 4hrs earlier at 6:10am. The helper was not there even while on the phone with customer service at 1045 and never responded to calls or messages.",
      "Fast, friendly everything went down exactly as promised. Would definitely use the service and this helper again!",
      "Fantastic",
      "I bought furniture from a girlfriend to move into my pool house so I would have a fully furnished rental. The building my girlfriend lived in, had very narrow hallways, so we were having to have her sofa craned off her balcony onto my moving truck. I use the Dolly app three days prior to my move and scheduled my move for 8 AM the morning of the move. I got confirmations via email and text so felt confident all would go well. Instead, I got a phone call at 7:15 that they were canceling my move because they had been unsuccessful unsecuring a crew! They did nothing to help and didn\u2019t even apologize for the inconvenience. The gentleman I spoke with who barely spoke. English told me I could reschedule my move or they would give me a full refund. A full refund for them doing nothing and putting me in a horribly awkward position\u2026 I would certainly hope so! I will never use Dolly again. I have used Lugg successfullyand will continue to do so. Good luck to anyone who uses Dolly. Trust me, based on my experience, you\u2019re going to need it!",
      "First time using the service that was recommended to me. My sister was giving me an expensive dresser. She had to help with the move on her end and I had to help to move on the delivery end. Both of us have several serious gouges in our walls. Would not use again. I am not part of the Dolly team and the point of hiring a professional moving service was to have someone else physically move this piece . Would love to share my pictures as they would likely cause you to reconsider. At least two of the gouges are at least half an inch deep and though Dolly sent me to their damages team, they refused to compensate me saying they don\u2019t cover environmental damage. Use real movers instead.",
      "First Dolly lead and helper were great but Martin at customer service confused the entire process and tried to over charge me.\n\nSome Dolly never showed up and customer service was no help. They also charged me $9 when I cancelled due to them not completing the job. \n\nI strongly do not recommend.",
      "To be fair, I\u2019ve used Dolly two times that worked exactly as I hoped.\n\nHowever, today, I\u2019d arranged for a pick up of an object that is 7 feet long. I wrote clearly in my description that the object was 84\u201d x 42\u201d and weighed about 40lbs.\n\nThe driver arrived with a pickup truck that looked too short. I asked him how long his truck bed was, and he said it was 5 feet long. I told him that it was simply not possible to move this object in his truck because it was too small.\n\nI have been charged $88 dollars for the cancellation. I\u2019ve been on the phone with customer service for the last 30 minutes. The person on the phone will not or cannot give me an adequate explanation why they will not refund me the $88 when their driver showed up with a truck that was too small to move my object.\n\nThe customer service representative even read my description back to me in which I wrote the dimensions of the object I needed to move.\n\nI am absolutely confounded. This charge is not ethical. Dolly needs to do a serious re-evaluation of its ethics and policies.",
      "Vance and his assistant Gotti were very willing to help me move my refrigerator and dishwasher in my house.   They were courteous and pleasant and made the job look like a breeze.  It was evident that they both enjoyed the work they do.  I would have them both as helpers again.   Thanks guys",
      "They keep giving me new times to pick up the mattress and then they never show up. Waste of time.",
      "The first time I used this service I requested 2 people to help move, and only one person showed up, luckily they refunded me for the person that didn\u2019t show but I had to scramble to find someone else. The second time I ordered this service for a friend and 2 people showed up, but they took off without warning and the excuse they gave was that I needed to be there with them.  despite my bad experiences, I thought that they might be unrelated so I tried them a third time which was by far the worst. I paid over $300 to move a one bedroom apartment for a neighbor who is down on her luck. when they arrived about a half hour before I got there my neighbor asked them to also move things out of another bedroom. And rather than telling her that they were only paid for one bedroom and moving just a one bedroom as a normal person would\u2019ve done. They canceled the entire job and left without moving anything before I arrived and charged me a 100% cancellation fee. That\u2019s right I paid over $300 for nothing, and had to scramble to get help.",
      "Angel was terrific.  He moved up the time at my request and then showed up even before that.  Handled the peloton bike with ease and expertise, and wiped the bike down before bribing it in my house!   I am highly satisfied",
      "Jhordan was very respectful and helpful. Helped me load and unload the U-Haul truck in no time. Definitely recommend.",
      "App froze before I could complete my request, which left me with an already paid for item unable to be transported to my home. There is no way to directly contact support, so I just have a support ticket they claim they will result over email and an item that I can\u2019t get to my house.",
      "Purchased a item in store that needed to be delivered.\n\nDolly couldn\u2019t \u201cfind movers\u201d for me.\n\nI\u2019ve spent over 4 hours in support with them and eventually told me \u201cgood luck just wait\u201d.\n\nIf a purchase requires Dolly in the future, I am running away",
      "Please do not use this service. We booked a week in advance only to have 1/2 of our helpers not show up (the person who did not show up had the pickup truck, of course). We were told to reschedule for an hour later by customer service and that someone would definitely take the job. No one showed up. We then rescheduled for the next day. Again, no one signed up. We had one person attempt to show up, only to have a very frustrating back and forth with the helper who insisted we needed to accept him for the job (there is literally no option to do this in the app). Both customer support and helper support were completely unable to do anything. I would never wish this experience on anyone. Please stay far, far away (unless you would also like to experience this nightmare).",
      "In theory, this service should have been great, but next time I\u2019ll be renting a U-haul and doing it myself.\n\nI hired a team of 2 Dolly movers to move a bed from Facebook Marketplace. The sellers disassembled the bed to help me \u201csave money\u201d with Dolly, so it was all ready to go when the movers arrived. Dolly added an extra $15 during the move because there was a flight of stairs at the seller\u2019s house (even though the pieces were all disassembled, so the movers weren\u2019t actually carrying any heavy objects down the stairs..)\n\nNo furniture pads were used, and they kept hitting the pieces on doors because they didn\u2019t bring door stops. Normal, experienced movers always have furniture pads and door stops. One of the pieces got a nice big scratch in it.\n\nThis wonderful service cost me a cool $278. SO not worth it. Next time, I\u2019ll be renting a U-haul.\n\nAdditionally, their app needs a lot of work. It won\u2019t let you do anything else in the app until you answer their prompts, so I couldn\u2019t do things like update my payment method or call customer service until I approved the $15 up  charge for the stairs. Annoying UX.",
      "I used Jeff C. For my Dolly in Philly burbs and he was on point! Personable, professional and on time! They didn\u2019t break even one item! Definitely give him a try!!!",
      "My first experience with Dolly was a great one. The two people with their truck arrived early and got right to work. We had to wait for about 10 minutes for a  consignment store to open and they didn\u2019t mind at all. They carried the heavy furniture in quickly and carefully. This whole process was easy!",
      "Great service, prompt and careful with my delivery.  Would highly recommend!",
      "These two gentlemen have superior work ethic, outstanding attitude, and customer service!\nThey did an excellent job in every way they went above and beyond what I had hoped or expected!",
      "It\u2019s a great way to get the support that you may need when your friends are not able to support you",
      "Jhony and his assistant were great- friendly and professional .",
      "Helper said he was coming 2 hrs before booking. Did not respond to any messages or calls during booked window. Left us standing in the rain waiting with a mattress. We ended up carrying/dragging it ourselves the 3 blocks we had hired him to drive it. Customer Support was useless. They would not give me a confirmation receipt for my full refund. I am hoping they at least refund me and I don\u2019t have to deal with them again. UNRELIABLE FLAKES, CUSTOMER SERVICE WILL NOT HELP, AVOID AT ALL COSTS",
      "Wonderful company wonderful fella such courtesy. Thank you thank you did a marvelous marvelous job I appreciate your company thank you again",
      "Booked a week before, he confirmed a couple of days before.  and then he just didn\u2019t show up.  Problem with dolly is there isn\u2019t a way to contact them with a problem.  The second helper, Duran, had to call for me to report the no show.  Luckily Duran was very helpful.   \n    I won\u2019t use dolly again.  I know you can\u2019t control if the helper shows up,  but you CAN make it easier to communicate and resolve problems.",
      "I just discovered this app. Today and it is amazing!!!! Great workers and awesome app.",
      "Sure it\u2019s easy to schedule but the workers are not vetted. Damaged my floors, walls, and the one time they were moving.",
      "I\u2019ve used Dolly in multiple states and for various different tasks. Always professional and helpful.",
      "Both Tyrell and Joe were excellent .. they arrived on time very courteous and took care of moving my items with care.",
      "Excellent, careful, pleasant, very helpful, clean truck, all the right equipment and padding.",
      "My move scheduled to start on Saturday at 12:30pm. All of my stuff is packed and I\u2019m just waiting for my movers to arrive. I get a call at 12:35 letting me know they cancelled it. The support team did not even attempt to help get another moving crew assigned. They didn\u2019t even apologize for it. \nIf you value your time and have timelines to meet, don\u2019t use this service.",
      "They sent two men unprepared to move an item with description, exact dimensions and photograph given.  \n\nCustomer service is a literal joke.  They are difficult to contact (the phone call does not go through).  Then they blamed me because they said the men were prepared to move (they weren\u2019t and advised me to cancel) so they only wanted to refund 50% of the job despite the fact that they weren\u2019t ready to move the furniture.\n\nDo not recommend.",
      "I recently relocated and needed last minute help unpacking a storage container. I was searching for moving services and they all seemed to charge an arm and a leg for services that I didn\u2019t really need. I took a chance on Dolly and was not disappointed. I booked moving help two days before my move in, they showed up early and had the job done quickly and with zero damage. You can select by items or by hours and customize your needs. I will be using this in the future!",
      "Very great service!!",
      "This was easy, priced well and the help was great. I will use this service again! Thank you",
      "I provided dimensions and images of the two items needed for pick up, a helper accepts the job and upon arrival he states that the items will not fit and would need to take two trips which will cost double . I call customer support and they\u2019re unable to help me. Managers are unavailable to further assist and will only contact you via email.",
      "The helper I booked from 11:30am to 1:30pm didn\u2019t show up. At 12pm I was notified in the Dolly App that a new person was automatically scheduled to come help with a start time at 1:30pm for 30 minutes - outside of the needed time. When I cancelled the second person, I was changed 20% cancellation fee!",
      "Charged my card immediately- nobody showed up. Phone number (from text) doesn\u2019t work. Found another customer service number and have been on hold for 20 minutes. Do not recommend!!",
      "I would give zero star if possible. Nothing happened after collecting the fees. No helper was available at all. Waited pass the schedule delivery time. Called customer service to cancel and refund, but again nothing happen to the scheduled order; no notification / email whatsoever. Only verbal assurance from the guy at the call center.",
      "Booked 2 helpers on two different days to help me move. \n\nOn both days helpers cancelled 10 minutes before the moving started and never came. \n\nScam company be careful !",
      "No useful communication or support from the Support Center. No one that ok my call, twice I was trying to call for 15 minutes. The \u2018live chat\u2019 is a useless AI robot.",
      "Apparently, the 4th time was charm.  Attempts 1, 2, and 3 were filled with problems - and while I appreciate Dolly\u2019s persistence, this delivery could have been much smoother.  For the 4th delivery, Dolly sent 4 and they were all needed!  The table is heavy marble and 2 men could not safely make the delivery - which involved an elevator that was a tight fit.  BUT by delivery #4 the 4 men were able to lift the table top replacement and install the hardware !  All\u2019s well that ends well.",
      "Moved an oversized chair from the 4th floor. On time and fast! Great service, will use again!",
      "I reserved two helpers yesterday but the lead helper never showed. He even texted and said he was five minutes away but never came. \n\nDolly then reduced the fee for the remaining worker by $20. I paid Dolly $100, but instead of paying the helper $80 as agreed, they only paid him $61. This is a ripoff and should be corrected. I asked to speak with a supervisor and was told there was not one who could speak with me. \n\nI will not use this company in the future if they refuse to honor to pay they workers as agreed.",
      "No customer service - dolly person canceled 15 minutes before schedule pick up. Dolly support didn\u2019t do a thing to help",
      "I have used Dolly at least 10 times. I always on time, polite guys, careful, and courteous.",
      "I had a worst experience with Dolly. The helper was so lazy, careless and had very uncleared vehicle. As I was moving stuff from a storage, he was just standing one place and pass heavy stuff to us. He even dropped a bag from a 7-8 feet height. And finally the helper added more amount as an adjustment, and it was just added to the final amount as if the customers do not have any ways to defend! I do not recommend this service. The customer support is not helpful or does not support customers but they more care for helper or drivers it seems! Thanks dolly team! \ud83d\ude07",
      "German and his helper we there absolute best!  Very professional, efficient, respectful and nice.  They arrived at the scheduled time and took over from there.  Using Dolly was easy and the communication between them and myself was exceptional.  I would highly recommend using Dolly for  a move!!!",
      "I signed up, ordered movers, got confirmation that my Dolly was all set. It was not. There was no mover. I had to call around the day of my move and find a real mover. This is barely a TechCrunch hackathon app, it\u2019s not a real company. Do not use.",
      "I scheduled a dolly to move my full size refrigerator. I included a photo of the refrigerator when I was making a reservation. The dolly helpers came unprepared (without moving straps) and canceled my reservation while still at my house. They told me they will come back tomorrow. They did not show up the next day and Dolly charged me a 50% cancellation fee for canceling same day. First of all, not my fault they came unprepared and secondly the helper canceled the reservation. I should not be responsible for a fee.",
      "I feel that most people can understand just how stressful moving can be. Earlier this week I had many reservations about using this company because my first mover didn\u2019t complete the job which left me in a hard place and the second mover cancelled on the day of the move. I was very frustrated with the situation. Dolly worked very hard to make up for everything. They had constant communication with me throughout the process and in the end sent me a 5 star mover named Eric who was phenomenal. I couldn\u2019t believe how easily he moved the heavy object independently. He was also reliable, respectful, and a great communicator.  Dolly did do a great job making up for errors that occurred earlier in the process, and I am very thankful for that.",
      "I needed an extra set of hands to load a van and move couches, tables, beds and dressers around the house.   The helper was not only strong but a good communicator when navigating walls, stairs and turns.   I will definitely use Dolly again!",
      "Quick, simple to book and so nice to find someone happily willing to help complete a task.",
      "Great job. Thanks",
      "Jervis and his assistant were really reliable and made me feel confident and trusting!",
      "I work at a world renown furniture company and my money is directly correlated to these drivers making their deliveries. I make sure to set it a week out so the movers have enough time to view and accept the loads. Time after time, I have movers who will cancel same day after accepting a week in advance, costing me $400+ in commission each time. If you can\u2019t handle the load, DON\u2019T ACCEPT IT! It\u2019s very frustrating and there\u2019s usually no fixing once something goes wrong. And if there is a solution, it happens days later giving the opportunity for the customer to cancel or just flat out wasting their time. If you have something small, go for it; but if it\u2019s any big item, I\u2019d say stay far away from dolly. This business model doesn\u2019t work if you can\u2019t be on site to handle situations with thousands of dollars worth of furniture. Apple needs to take them down expeditiously.",
      "I\u2019ve used Dolly Delivery twice now in partnership with the Container Store for custom closet installations and have been generally pleased with the service received.  John, our \u201chelper\u201d today was friendly, polite, quick so I was happy to tip him.  The one thing I would have liked is a \u201cconfirm\u201d call the day before and/or day of the delivery.  I spent sometime trying to track down the delivery.  It would have been nice to have a phone number to call Dolly or the helper directly.  The people at the Container Store were helpful and knowledgeable (Laura) and the people at TCS Installation (Penmarc) also were concerned and helpful.",
      "I paid for 2 helpers only to load my truck (not unload), which is a minimum of 2 hours, $200. One of them showed up on time ready to work, the other one was about 45 minutes to an hour late and it just took an hour and a half total. My truck looked like they just threw my things in it, my leather chair was ripped, my new desk had black marks on the top that won\u2019t come off, my relatively new couch, which was in excellent condition, is now torn in several spots and has black stains. I\u2019m going to have to make another trip (5 hours away) to get the rest of my things because they didn\u2019t load it properly and make it fit right. I used Dolly once before and the head helper was very good, made everything fit perfectly. I got the same size truck so it should\u2019ve definitely fit! Since the assistant helper was so late, the head helper could only do so much, which I think played a big role in why my stuff was simply tossed in wherever. I\u2019m beyond upset about this and I firmly believe I deserve at least a partial refund. I will NOT be using Dolly again!",
      "I\u2019m not real pleased that I got what I paid for. I was going to use you on the other end, but I don\u2019t think so. I would not recommend the type of help I received today. on the bright side, he was breathing. he did help some.",
      "Movers were professional and efficient.",
      "The gentleman were professional, nice, and they communicated well. \n\nThey are highly intelligent, with great problem solving skills. \n\nThey are an asset to your company.\n\nGreat work,\n\nPaul Sawicki",
      "Dolly helper didn\u2019t show up. Was scheduled days in advance. Limited support from customer support team during scheduled service. \nHelper was busy with another job and said he would be late (fine) but 2 hours after scheduled start time, he never showed and stopped responding.",
      "Speedy + efficient!",
      "Excellent professional and on time. Did a great job",
      "Did not show up, no helper was ever assigned. Called the day of (5 hrs before the start time) and tried to confirm that a helper would be assigned. They said yes, and not to worry. So I drove out to the move start location, and a helper was never assigned. No communication from the Dolly company. Nothing. Very bad experience. Will never use or recommend them again.",
      "I can\u2019t say enough about how easy this was!  I needed four large heavy items moved quickly.  With one day notice, I scheduled movers to bring the items about 30 miles.  The guys were polite and very careful. One item was a fragile grandfather click and it was delivered with care!",
      "My wife and I have used Dolly at least 6 times, it\u2019s gotten us out of the jams we faced of purchasing items we couldn\u2019t move ourselves. We never had a problem with any of the movers, some have gone above and beyond the regular level of service!",
      "I paid for two movers and a truck. I had 5 men show up and then the guy told me that my stuff wasn\u2019t \u201cready\u201d because I didn\u2019t have supplies? Like blankets and moving supplies?\u2026which I thought was included in the package? So he guilted me in to giving them an extra $200 and he had suggested giving them an extra $300. I had called the company and asked about this, they said the supplies were included in the package. I\u2019m also pretty confident one of them stole my marijuana as well. The move was quick though.",
      "I was charged 20% of my job because the helper was unavailable during the window. He agreed to. Support refused to credit me. Consider using a different app or service as you may get taken too.",
      "I just moved into a new home and once the boxes were unpacked, and furniture placed, it became obvious that several big heavy chairs and rolled carpets needed to be moved. Also, a treadmill needed to be repositioned\u2026.none of which I could do on my own. Enter Dolly. I scheduled and two professional gentlemen arrived to get the jobs done! Great communication and friendly service. Excellent idea for those nagging tasks you can\u2019t manage on your own. Highly recommend.",
      "Twice helpers either canceled on me or I could not get ahold of the would be helpers! Though I lost the 24 hrs deposit, i got peace of mind by using a standard moving company. So I don\u2019t recommend this service!!!",
      "I\u2019ve used Dolly 3 times to have furniture delivered to my house from the RH Outlets in Limerick and Princeton, my favorite outlets to shop, and each time Dolly has had the best price, the fastest turn around (even same day!) and no issues whatsoever. The delivery drivers and assistants are on time and friendly. You should try it if you haven\u2019t already.",
      "Dolly provided me with a very good helper to unload my pod at the last minute request. I was very pleased with the help Neiro N provided. He was very pleasant, very professional, and very efficient, and most of all very hard worker. I would actually rate him 10 stars if there was a 10 star rating. he was also on time.\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",
      "All went as planned, thank you so much!",
      "They did a great job and placed the closet system in the right area with care.",
      "Customer service is only via text, you are truly at their mercy. Twice I sat on hold for 10 minutes  and realized there is no call center! Finally I got a text from a mover saying he could do my move now. He was great, as was his assistant.  They were the saving grace of an otherwise frustrating day.  Their staff and movers are great, but too unorganized to work with again with short notice. Maybe booking a couple of weeks out is better, but last minute, not so much.",
      "Over a 24 hour period there were two different helpers assigned to my situation. Neither of them followed through. I attempted to communicate with Dolly through their website. This create another frustrating situation as I didn\u2019t receive any callbacks. After waiting all day to hear from my helper. I suddenly received a refund from Dolly without explanation.",
      "I\u2019ve used this app to move heavy items and will continue because I definitely can\u2019t move a refrigerator downstairs",
      "Excellent Service",
      "Super easy to book and take worries out of delivery and moves!",
      "Great",
      "I\u2019m very impressed with Dolly, and I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to use Dolly again.  The moving helpers were punctual, pleasant, and prepared for the task.",
      "My first and last experience was horrible. The dolly helper showed up three hours early then scheduled after I told him to wait. They tried to charge me an extra 45 dollars and customer service was less then helpful. Use another platform",
      "Rob and Christian were awesome! They were quick, efficient, helpful and friendly. This was a great experience. Thanks guys!",
      "This is the best app for moving with a resonable price. People are also professional",
      "Was very quick because it was an emergency I needed movers they confirmed and was early and courteous I will definitely use them again and I recommend them.",
      "Remember when moving big stuff included the ordeal of finding strong people and a truck, then coordinating schedules? Those days are over. I\u2019ve used Dolly twice. Once it was \u201cregular people\u201d and once it was professional movers. Both teams did great. Loved how easy it was!",
      "Shakari and Tyler were great and the overall experience with Dolly was amazing.",
      "Great communication",
      "I\u2019ve never had a \u201cgood\u201d experience booking movers through dolly. I\u2019ve used the app three times and each time one (or both) of the movers are unhelpful, do the bare minimum, or slightly damage the items being moved/floors/walls. From what I\u2019ve heard this is potentially partly due to \u201chelpers\u201d being subcontracted out, so if you\u2019re getting more than one person beware of diminishing returns. \n\nAlso, the movers are very quick to add expenses to your bill and I\u2019ve had to argue with customer support and substantiate my claims when I am over billed (billed for moving 7 chairs when only 4 were moved, gently removing the top of a glass table to make it an easier move is suddenly a substantial disassembly fee, etc)\n\nOverall, I will be taking my business elsewhere in the future and wouldn\u2019t recommend this service. Decent in a pinch but be ready for issues to arise.",
      "It was easy to sign up and list what I needed help to move. I put in all the details I could and someone accepted it and helped me big time! Even during the holiday!!!",
      "Fortunately for me my friend was waiting at the pickup spot to meet the helper so she alerted me when he didn\u2019t  show.  When I called him he didn\u2019t care that he was running over an hour late and hadn\u2019t bothered to notify me.  The estate sale where the pickup was to occur was nice about it so they were ok with my revised pickup time.    Helper picked up 1 1/2 hours later than was scheduled.  \n\nDon\u2019t use Dolly if you have time restrictions as they have limited control of the helpers so you are at the helper\u2019s whim.  In the end I was just glad that he showed up.",
      "It\u2019s all good until your \u201chelpers\u201d don\u2019t show up or, alternatively, show up and cancel because l they don\u2019t want to do a job. We were stranded in the middle of a move and couldn\u2019t reach Dolly. They don\u2019t freaking care\u2014and won\u2019t let me leave a review to warn others to avoid these \u201chelpers.\u201d",
      "Delivery went smoothly. Great communication. On time, and took care bringing the 3 pieces of the sectional into the house and setting it up.",
      "We had no clue that such a service existed. Because of health issues it was impossible for us to transport the items we needed moved. I will definitely be using this company again when necessary!",
      "I scheduled a Dolly to help me pickup and deliver one item to my apartment.  I scheduled the dolly several days in advance for a 6pm pickup.  \n\nThe day comes and I get a notification that the Dolly pickup time has been pushed back to later in the night, not a big deal.  My Dolly assistant assured me that the pickup and delivery will still occur even though it has been delayed.  I never hear back from Dolly and I am completely ghosted.\n\nDolly services ended up being a huge waste of time for myself and the individual that I was purchasing from.  I would not recommend to anyone.",
      "App has changed not what it was. They cut off communication with helper on the app when the stop the dolly if there are questions there is no way to adjust. Support cannot help \nIt\u2019s really gone downhill \nIt was a great service but not anymore",
      "2 stars, only because the people on the phone were nice. \nThe company \u201c withheld \u201c 115 dollars from my account, then waited till the end of the day to tell me they couldn\u2019t find anyone. I actually had to call to find out there was nobody to help. After further inconveniences I realized I\u2019d have to wait 3-5 business days to get my money back, yet it was \u201c on hold \u201c\nFrom the beginning. Do not recommend, ask a friend for help it\u2019s cheaper and you can pay them after the job is done.",
      "Thanks Richard snd Amber! You both were professional and timely! You ROCK",

      "This was the easiest move since Dolly did all the heavy lifting and moving. Our helper John L was awesome. He was on time, friendly and hard working. John and his assistant were very efficient and treated our belongings with care. I will definitely use Dolly again!",
      "My wife and I have hired Garphil and a helper two years in a row for a pretty difficult move. Both times involved multiple floors, antique furniture, and tight corners. They exceeded expectations and we will 100% hire them again if/when we move next!",
      "I find it irrational that they charge you to cancel but give no credits or communication if there is a no show. \nBetter success through other apps",
      "I was rescheduled 4 times before a helper finally was scheduled. But they couldn\u2019t do it until 7 hours after my original time. Then 5 minutes before the move I was notified by text that the helper cancelled. Gigantic waste of my time and money.",
      "Thank you for helping me move a few items within my home, up and down stairs. Your service is highly valuable. \nVery professional, kept me in the know about arrival, timely and courteous.",
      "Highly recommend this service.",
      "Zavier B. and his helper did a great job moving our refrigerators and display unit yesterday. Communication was outstanding; we knew exactly what time to expect then at our house. Once there, they were very friendly and respectful of our property. We would definitely use Dolly again and recommend to our friends.",
      "Excellent, quick and reasonably priced service. I had them pick up a bunch of slate patio pavers from someone who was selling on Facebook marketplace. They arrived within 18 hours of my request, loaded drove 20miles and unloaded within 1.5 hours. It would have taken me all day!",
      "Dolly really came through in our time of need! We had a flood which, in order to repair the 2 rooms, needed all the furniture moved out of them.\nDaniel H. and Andres J. were very good workers! Professional all the way; easy to talk to and efficient. I highly reccomend using this service for moves.",
      "First I try schedule through the app 1x day in advance and it doesn\u2019t even work. \nThen I went on the computer at work the next morning first thing and got confirmation my Dolly was scheduled for that evening. \nMy Dolly helper even contacted me confirming they\u2019d be there and asked if they could come early. \nWhen they cancelled at the last second - left me no time to replace them and the support couldn\u2019t even give me a discount or help at all with the situation. There wasn\u2019t even a manager to speak to. They said they email me back sometime soon. How does that help me now? \nTerrible service 1x star and now I can\u2019t get my spare bedroom ready for my in laws coming in",
      "Do yourself a favor and DO NOT use this service for a move. I have never had a worse moving experience or a worse experience with the company after the fact.\n \nI cannot stress enough that EVERY SINGLE box I opened had broken items in it, the movers broke my bed, snapping the metal supports in half and they broke my window AC unit by causing a GIANT dent in the frame, so deep that the internal fan hits it when you turn the AC on. The movers were rude, inappropriate and took literally 0 care with my stuff.\n \nI live in NYC and was moving to another part of the city, not too far away. My old apartment was up two flights of stairs and the second was one flight of stairs. Just want to put into perspective that this was not a difficult move, I was not going very far and the movers/helpers did not have to go up 5 flights of stairs. \n \nIts no exaggeration that every single box I opened had broken items in it. I\u2019ve done big moves, from FL to NYC, NYC to DC, DC to NYC and within NYC. I\u2019ve moved myself, hired other movers and had friends help in the past. I have NEVER had a worse moving experience, and I moved right after a blizzard before (trust me, I had no choice and it was awful). NEVER in my life, have I seen so many broken items, never. \n \nEvery box I opened had more and more broken stuff in there. I don\u2019t mean chips, or a scuff, I mean hard metal items totally damaged, with metal pieces concaved in on themselves, glasses broken, standing fans totally broken, even my bookcase, that had a metal frame and is mountable to the wall is broken. The metal is so far bent that it cannot even stand up straight and no amount of effort seems to help get it back in alignment. \n \nAll of this is upsetting on its own, then comes my experience after the fact. I paid for extra insurance \u201cjust in case\u201d \u2013 so I was covered up to $2,500 for related damages. The total amount of damages was well over $3,000. Dolly, after weeks of back and forth, me sending pictures of all the damage, receipts showing the cost of the items and providing an itemized list of the damaged items, along with their prices, Dolly finally tells me how much they\u2019re prepared to offer me. $291. \n \nLet me say that again, Dolly offered me $291, less than 10% of the actual value of the total value for items like my bed, where the frame was literally broken in half and AC unit, which was so damaged that the internal fan scrapes against the exterior metal frame were not covered because they were considered  to be  \"regular moving wear and tear such as minor dents, stains or scratches.\"\n \nI am in the process of trying to get more money through my insurance claim, but I\u2019m on day 2 of no response from Dolly. Do yourself the ultimate favor and never use this moving company. I understand that not all moves will be like this and other movers may be better, but in case something does go wrong, like what happened with me, Dolly will do absolutely nothing to help you.",

      "We had a few issues with them taking a while to get there BUT there were thorough and friendly and very helpful.",
      "I\u2019ve used the app before with no issue. I reinstalled the app to help with an upcoming move, and it won\u2019t allow me to book timed help or the alternative, to book by item. I search for an item, and nothing appears. Frustrated as I had a good experience in the past. Would like to book but I cannot!",
      "The helpers arrived early which is always great to be on time. They moved the most of the furniture we designated. They were is a rush and agitated that this was taking over 45 minutes (paid for minimum 2 hrs). Not rude by not pleasant either.  Would not disassemble a swing to move.  Didn\u2019t want to clean up the debris left during the move.  Not sure I\u2019d invite this crew back.",
      "I booked my dolly to help me move about a week before i needed them. The day of, 15 minutes before they were supposed to arrive i got a notification that my dolly, Nicodemus, cancelled and my dolly was now scheduled to be at 8:30 pm at night with someone else. When i tried calling support they offered no solution and said they are allowed to cancel that last minute, but i was not able to cancel within the 24 hour window binding me to the 8:30pm moving help.",

      "This is an \u201cinstacart\u201d or \u201cuber\u201d of moving meaning you rely on the UNKNOWN availability of helpers. If you are trying to set a moving day, DON\u2019T USE THIS SERVICE. They will make you wait until the time of your move to cancel or delay your move further into the future to benefit themselves while you are left high and dry without a mover."

      "We booked Dolly several months in advance to help move items for our wedding. Although movers had been assigned well in advance, on the day of our wedding, we opened the app only to discover that they were no longer assigned, leaving us without anyone to assist with our move. Dolly never communicated this to us, leaving us completely in the dark even on the day of the event. When we contacted customer service, they informed us that while drivers may have been messaging us, no one was officially assigned. They blamed an automated system and claimed there was nothing they could do. Their \u201csolution\u201d was to suggest moving our scheduled time back a few hours, hoping it might get assigned. This made no sense\u2014why would a few hours change anything after months of inaction? We explained that this was for our wedding and rescheduling wasn\u2019t an option, but they offered no other alternatives. As a result, we spent the morning of our wedding frantically searching for other movers to transport our decor. It was an incredibly stressful experience and completely avoidable. Dolly\u2019s service was absolutely unacceptable and added unnecessary chaos to what should have been a joyful day.",
      "I scheduled this slot for 5-6. At 5:15 I received a message stating that the Dolly app was not working and they stopped earlier in the day. However, they waited until the last minute to send me a message! I called and I spoke to Kelly Hunter who\u2019s name does not match her accent! She could not provide me with a call reference number ! She said I would get a refund within 24-48 hours. If not I will be writing another bad review!!",
      "Very frustrating experience for me as I placed the entire moving order (and binding $$ contract as it was a next day request) on my phone using the app. As soon as I double clicked Apple Pay to pay, the app crashed. I then submitted a Help request as my info appeared lost and got a phone call from someone in India. She had to retake my entire request over the phone \u2014however submitted it incorrectly and put the wrong address and wrong time in the request. (I wanted the driver at 9:30 in the morning. I got a message at 6:30 in the morning that they were on their way almost there, and the business wasn\u2019t open.) I could not reach anyone to talk to and the chat did not work at all. Additionally, the farmed out helpdesk in India (I believe) had rude personnel. I would not recommend this app until they clean things up. The only way I was able to reach someone was through an anonymous text message I got at 6:30 in the morning \u2026 I called that number.  \nFortunately, they answered. The driver was awesome/very nice crew and I felt sorry for them.",
      "Totally upset that I tried this service. Needed mover from 11-12 and no one shows up. Charged $800 and I\u2019m being told I can\u2019t get a refund!!! This is ridiculous! Can\u2019t even speak to a manger!!! The worst!",
      "This service is worthless. You can set a time window, but what they don\u2019t tell you is that they don\u2019t actually confirm if someone will be there in your time window UNTIL you\u2019re already in that time window. So you can\u2019t plan anything. My window came and went, and customer service just shrugged their shoulders.",
      "We scheduled a Dolly service a month in advance. 10 minutes prior to the scheduled arrival timeframe, we received a notification from Dolly that our movers cancelled. Due to Dolly\u2019s limited support hours, we couldn\u2019t contact non-AI assistance and no movers were reassigned to help us. Absolutely terrible experience. We wouldn\u2019t recommend to anyone.",
      "Had to throw away a $1000 couch because the \u201cmovers\u201d attempted to get it through the door once for 3 mins and asked what do I want to do with it? I want it in my house! They continued to sit it next to the trash",
      "I do not recommend Dolly to anyone. They canceled my Dolly and still charged me for it. It\u2019s impossible to reach an actual rep that can help you. All you will get it terribly automated email responses if you encounter any issue. Spend the extra $100 anywhere else and never use this company.",
      "They have taken money out of my account without providing services and I am fighting to get my money back now. \nThere is no customer service number. Do not use this app. It is just an app no actual people work there.",
      "I used a couple of times. You can\u2019t chose the movers so I got someone who had low ratings and was really rude and aggressive. Don\u2019t use the app",
      "So I typically don\u2019t leave reviews BUT I want to warn people who use this in FLORIDA. It\u2019s not good for last minute. You have to PAY TO BOOK. If they can\u2019t find someone to take your booking they still hold your money for 24-48 hours. In my opinion it makes no sense at all. This was on a Saturday so I get it\u2019s busy but it was marked as available. I was supposed to pick up a couch and bed set by 12 and I put in the request like around 6 am. They couldn\u2019t fulfill it and they didn\u2019t notify me until it was after 12. They called and said to schedule it later in the day. (Side note the outsource their calling so do not expect great customer service) I scheduled it 2 hours later and they still couldn\u2019t fulfill it and didn\u2019t bother to call either. So I had cancelled because screw this Uhaul is low key cheaper anyway. Now my budget is thrown off and I might miss out on these items. BEWARE OF THIS INCONVENIENT SERVICE.",
      "They were almost 4 hours late claiming a fridge delivery. It started out as 2 hours late and then messages came progressively from there stating a later and later arrival. When I called customer service to see how they would reimburse me they had no solutions saying they don't do discounts or reimbursement and it it was impossible to do so......yeah ok. Additionally the driver told them his truck broke down sooooo then he lied to me or both of us about why he was late. Once they arrived they moved quickly and we're polite. All's I'm saying is if you foce us to book a time then you should stick to that agreement and if not there should be a way to correct it. If I wasn't ready and I wasn't on time I would have faced a penalty but clearly they have no way to fix it when it's the other way around, or so they claimed. Spend your money on a different service of which many are available, this one ain't it.",

      "They take 50% of the fees. The workers are low-paid and unprofessional. I end up paying $850 for moving my 1bedroom apartment. Because the workers are unprofessional and their vehicle cannot fit in all my stuff they have to do two trips (I did double checked with them in the chat and they insisted that a cargo van is enough). They also broke two of my tables and left stains everywhere on my stuff (the van is as dirty as you can imagine, and they have no protection wraps for the furniture).\n\nBut I would not blame the workers too much as they are low-paid. This app took money from both party while they did nothing. I was fooled by the \"Updater\" website that comes with my new apartment. The have a move in checklist and one of them is moving with Dolly. This is a scam put up by both these scammers. If you use this app, expect the highest price you ever experienced, the minimal service (packing and doing lots of stuff yourself), longest hours (8 hours for my moving even though I'm helping all the way), and damaged furniture. You can get professional pack and move for $500.\n\nThis app should just die and I strongly suggest that everyone (customers and workers alike) stays away from it.",

I called customer service and spoke with a representative who had difficulty communicating in English. He informed me that assistance was not coming at that time, and the next available opportunity for help would be at 7:30 PM or the following day.

Given my tight timeline to move out, I was left anxious and uncertain about whether help would arrive. At 3 PM, I received an email stating that no movers had taken the job, and I would not be getting the assistance I needed. \n\nThis experience was extremely disappointing.

On top of it, they had to take it back to the store because it would not fit. They put holes in the walls, ceiling, hit the corners so bad the metal corner bead was exposed in several locations. Now here is the best part, the guy is oh let me take pics for insurance purposes lol, Dolly will cover $300 no matter how much damage these helpers do as they consider them contractors and are not liable for anything they do, got to love ! Now, we just moved into this brand new townhouse with $1900 worth of damage and they will only cover $300. Here is the kicker, on that day after the guys left to return the sectional to the store I get a call from Dolly wanting to charge me a additional $50 for them taking it back ( yeah I don\u2019t think so ) and they charged me the full $203 for the service which is just crazy to me. So, $203 for service $1900 worth of damage and you will give $300 for it, so basically I got $100 towards the damage is the way I look at this. DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE !!! YOU HAVE BEEN WORNED !!!",

Instead of apologizing he continued be defensive till I told him to get off my property. Meanwhile I was on the phone attempting to contact dolly support the entire time with no answer.

Which essentially charges you incrementally based on time. \nI was out money for something they couldn\u2019t do. \nI\u2019m extremely disappointed.

They canceled my trip not I. And the app charged me 520 dollars than because the crew said they weren\u2019t getting paid I payed them again 250. Plus I had to hire three additional workers at a cost of 150 dollars because the criminals barely showed up with a dolly 1/2 the size of my own. So where am I at. It cost me 1000 dollars today to move an item roughly the same size as a refrigerator. I have asked to be refunded 520 dollars and was told no. This is a scam and 1000 dollars was stolen from me. They did deliver it but refused to even put it up right so I\u2019ve had to do alone which I was able to do because I\u2019m not an idiot.

Called support at 9:30am, who said job actually wouldn\u2019t be able to be booked after 10am unless she rescheduled it. Couldn\u2019t confirm what \u201ctop priority\u201d tomorrow morning would entail.  She said she had to give new potential Helpers 3-4hr window, and then rescheduled it \u2014 for midday *tomorrow*, which I realized after checking the post in my app. I quickly changed back to today, but no takers. Stressed me out bad enough that I cancelled to request in general a couple of hours later. Now I have no movers. Oh, and I\u2019m still being charged $9 \u201cservice fee\u201d. Bad job, Dolly.",
      "The app cancels jobs without alerting you.",
      "They came with three people for a standard fridge something me and my uncle moved together. They didn\u2019t have a dolly, but they work for Dolly. They didn\u2019t put effort and get in the fridge out the door proclaiming the doors need to be took off again something my 74 year old uncle was able to accomplish after sitting in the car while I was waiting for them to get out they called and reported to Dolly that they had said at least that because that\u2019s what they did for the 45 minutes so my delivery was castle and I had to pay Dolly 100% for the schedule move. DO NOT BOOK WITH HIM",
      "We did not have a great experience with our service. I specifically noted the job needed a tall ladder. They showed up without one. I communicated via the app to schedule the same person for the next day. He told me he\u2019d be there and never showed up :(",
      "Dolly is disappointing. Never going to use it again. I payed Dolly as an extra just because I wanted to pick up a timeframe and Ikea didnt offer this option. \n\nBy the morning the first driver sent me a message he was going to deliver it by 5- 5:30 PM ( more than 1 hour after I asked for). \n\nDolly called me by the end of the period I selected telling me the provider had an issue. I got my packages only at 7:30 PM!!!! The same time I had a business meeting. Im sad and angry to pay good amount of dollars for this kind of service.",
      "No one showed up",
      "they canceled within 1 hour of the time they were scheduled for",
      "If you have no other option buyer be aware. Herman and deleon I believe was their names. Let\u2019s start off with that when the helper got there he thought was moving stuff from upstairs to downstairs. Granted we gave them two addresses so not sure where the stupidity started. So then the other shows up thirty minutes late. They was supposed to bring truck but guess they thought since was a woman they could try and weasel their way out. Well joke on them cause I didn\u2019t return the uhaul van yet. So then they had no choice but to continue job. I was at work and my sister was there. She recorded all and audio as well. They talked so much that they literally almost ran my headboard into the living room wall. They damaged the old property wall, they didn\u2019t even load up everything. Mind you I paid for two hours and got work of one hour and ten minutes. So moving on to the other house. They was refusing to unload everything and threaten to take off with stuff. My sister got this all on recording till I told her to tell them Newark police who I know some officers can be called. All of sudden they started to unload. They damaged my dressers, my tv stand and footboard. The way he spoke to my sister and the damage he did you are better off picking someone off the internet who never has done this before. Those other reviews must be bogus. The google reviews I wish I had found first cause they are spot on. Stay away from this company unless you don\u2019t care to spend money and have your stuff damaged.",
      "Great concept but terrible execution and poor customer service.  My Dolly order got rescheduled and ultimately cancelled and messed up my entire weekend.  Tried this service once and won\u2019t try again.",
      "Moving in the city is already the worst experience but don\u2019t worry they can make it way worse by cancelling last minute and screwing you over! Stay away!",
      "I was excited that there was a company that could pick up items from stores that don\u2019t offer that service.  I sadly received such poor service that I can\u2019t recommend this company based on my experience.  The helper stated that he would arrive at the store at 4:30.   We had to call him after he was an over a hour late.  He arrived not dressed to move furniture in a dinner jacket and dress shoes.  The additional helper that we paid for  was not with him.  The store employees had to load the item which was very heavy.  Which I had provided a picture and stated that it was very heavy when I scheduled the pick up.  He also arrived with no equipment to move or secure anything.  He did not secure the item in his truck and once he arrived was unable to get it into the house.  Overall, a horrible experience and he charged extra to take the item off of his truck.  Long and short of my story, after paying almost paying $200 the item did not end up in the house and could have been damaged.  I would have been better renting a truck and having the workers load the item, which they did anyway.",
      "Never showed, rebooked, never showed up again. \n\nPlease don\u2019t take time off from work when using them. \n\nHorrible mistake.",
      "I put in a request last week and Dolly just processed it today and said that no one can help. I then got a message from someone saying they could help but Dolly has not assigned him to help. I have a specified time from when I needed something moved/picked up. Don\u2019t recommend going through Dolly. Customer service has been really bad.",
      "I hired two men through Dolly to move a couch from my garage into my house/living room. Took 10 minutes. I was charged $160!!!  Never. Again.",
      "This place is so unorganized and unprofessional not worth the money they charge.",
      "Dolly has a helper assigned and then pulled them off the order and couldn\u2019t get anyone else to \u201chelp\u201d. I extended my timeframe as they requested and still not a success. Will not be using or recommending in the future.",
      "Hired them to deliver furniture and had no one assigned for hours even though app says they will get back to you within an hour. I don\u2019t know why Costco recommends this service- absolute waste of time. Customer service has no idea what their policies are and just made up random things. I had to call them when nobody showed up and chase them multiple times to see why they had not assigned a helper. Waste of time. Don\u2019t bother.",
      "Totally a scam. They charged me a delivery fee of 49.00 and they told me someone cancelled the delivery. Well in fact why will i cancel it. Now they want me to set another schedule for a different rate and have it charged again. Totally a scam!",
      "I setup movers to arrive at 9 am to move my father to a new assisted living place. He had to move that day.  At 9:02 am, Dolly called to tell me no one was coming. No warning at all, leaving me in a terrible position.  \n\nAt very least, they should give a warning this might happen 48 hours in advance. \n\nDon\u2019t use them if you have to move something on a certain day.  And no apologies or anything.  And no one to speak to other than a customer service rep reading a script.  Horrible experience.",
      "Enormously disappointed that the dolly app took my credit card for the same item to be picked up and delivered same time same place\nObviously a mistake \nCan someone please contact me regarding this oversight",
      "After 2 different days of not being able to find a helper in NY, they notified me at the last 5 minutes of the estimated window. Not only that, but they told me they would cancel it on their end, so the system wouldn\u2019t allow me to cancel myself and then a week later they charged me!!!! Stay away, fraud!",
      "App showed helpers with pick up truck but only labor showed up. I was told because I lived in WA? App still showed 2 helpers with vehicle were booked and coming\u2026 Nothing moved and I was subsequently billed 100%. Customer service does not help and they hide behind an email from a response team that denies your refund. Beware booking with them. Zero accountability after you book and pay.",
      "They\u2019ll call you 30 minutes before your scheduled delivery just to say there will be no Dolly to pick up for you.\n\nThey then refuse to guarantee any other time for pick up, dragging you along through the call with barely understandable English. It\u2019s hard to be compassionate when you can\u2019t even hear why you are not able to receive the services you pay for. Disappointed in Dolly this time around",
      "My 1st Dolly experience went off without a hitch on 5/14/24. They communicated with me regularly until my washer and dryer was loaded. My 2nd Dolly experience was awful. If I could give this less than zero stars I would. I had zero communication from the initial time that the helper communicated with me that he and his helper would arrive on 5/15/24. The customer service agents did not understand that I was on an extremely tight schedule because I had a rental to return by a certain time and could offer no flexibility in getting someone to help me. I was excited about this service but not anymore. It takes one bad experience to ruin it all.",
      "The worker damaged my table then decided to cancel the booking and blamed me for booking incorrectly which caused me to be charged the full $276 for the move. Dolly customer support kept reading from a script and would not give me a refund despite me explaining that the mover lied in their cancellation report.",
      "They charge you for each small items in a bag instead of the bag. Once you select what you want to have delivered the helpers will change it up so it is the most expensive way to deliver possible. What started out as a $65 delivery fee turned into a $300 fee. Because instead of the the 3 grocery bags being charged they charged me per item inside the grocery bags.\n\nAlso you won\u2019t be able to reach customer support in any reasonable time and when they finally call you back you will hardly be able to understand the Indian person they outsourced their call center too.",
      "Worst experience! Bought a sectional couch and had to request dolly to pick up and drop off. They never assigned anyone to pick it up and it past the time TWICE! Their call center is in EST and aren\u2019t helpful. They just rescheduled the dolly and said they are trying to find someone. No one came to pick it up and I only got a notification that they were cancelling it. Never ordering here again!",
      "I regret using Dolly and will NEVER use it again and tell everyone I know looking to move to avoid it. I had a last minute move to a new apartment and someone recommended this app. Going through the process to schedule someone was quick and easy. However, I had a terrible experience with the two helpers. They were poorly equipped with moving furniture. I was watching them the whole time and they were not careful with my items. One dropped a box of dishes. Same one had stacked way too many boxes on the trolley that were about to fall off when he went up a ramp, so I had to run over to tell him to stop and unload some of them. When I politely asked them to be more careful, they escalated it into an argument. They were constantly complaining and unprofessional. I paid and tipped them and tried to call it a day. However, it\u2019s been two years and to this day I still feel upset over the experience. If you value your personal items, some of which are irreplaceable, hire an actual professional moving company than go through this app",
      "They lie, manipulate and steal your money. I would not recommend to my worst enemy, although the staff was great.",
      "For time I used dolly, the drivers got lost and could not communicate.\n\nI am now 4 hours past delivery time with no end in site, no communication.\n\nWill avoid at all costs on a go forward",
      "Dolly movers are unreliable and not communicative. Twice I have tried to move with Dolly and twice I have ended up renting a U-Haul and moving myself. \n\nMost recently, my assigned mover canceled at 3am the day of my 10am move. Dolly reassigned me a mover that had a much smaller vehicle and window of time to perform my move. Instead of an apology for the last-minute change that made my move impossible, Dolly insisted on charging 50% of the booking fee for cancelling within 24 hours of my move. \n\nSave yourself the stress and hire real movers. Avoid Dolly at all costs.",
      "The company will not stand behind their customers. Do NOT recommend.",
      "I was fully conned out of nearly $300. When my Dolly movers arrived, they decided my apartment was too big and would take too much time. This is despite the fact that I sent pictures of every inch of my apartment with everything that will need to be moved. They then refused to provide me a refund and then said I would be charged for a cancellation fee. They said if I wanted other movers to come today I would have to submit a new request.",
      "This company is by far the worst I\u2019ve ever dealt with. They will take your money and cancel your move just because. Please do not ever book with these people.",
      "This company is pretty much a scam haven't received payment in almost a month I was told by a support agent I would receive it right away every time I called until the last time where the lady said she \u201chopes I receive my payment\u201d when I've driven hundreds of miles and haven't received payment even if I ever get my money they have no remorse how could they tale  customers hard earn money and keep it.To not pay any of there drivers on time. I have medical bills for puppy to pay I couldn\u2019t afford to just be driving around for weeks to not get payments.",
      "If I could give zero stars I would.  I had booked the service for an item to be delivered at 2 PM. At 3:30 they called and said it would not be coming for several more hours.  Which defeated the purpose of the delivery. I asked how they would rectify the situation and they told me they are not willing to do anything, not even discount the service they completely messed up with no call to let me know. They did say they would not charge me a cancellation fee for not picking up my item and not delivering it. So they are saying they won\u2019t charge me for doing absolutely nothing, thanks. \n\nThey would not let me speak to a manager and were not willing to help me in any way. Complete joke of a service",
      "I was waiting for days for this service. I went with a better company. Do NOT use this service!",
      "TERRIBLE. NO SERVICE WAS DONE WHAT SO EVER AND I STILL GOT CHARGED 95$",
      "I asked the movers when they arrived if I needed to pack the tv. They told me they had it.  They proceeded to break my tv and now dolly is telling me because I didn\u2019t pack and protect the tv that they won\u2019t pay me back for the TV their movers broke.  The Assistant showed up an hour and a half late. And I moved as much as the movers. When I paid for them to do it all.  I also tipped them huge before I realized the tv was broken.  \n\nI will never use dolly again.  If they had negative stars I would give it.",
      "I booked three weeks ago to move apartments and they called me 30 minutes before they were supposed to be here to say they didn\u2019t have any helpers booked. Now I\u2019m getting expensive movers and out money. Garbage.",
      "Disappointed.\nBad service.  Don\u2019t use Dolly.\nThey cancelled your order 5 minutes before the end of the day.  They use unprofessional mover.",
      "Terrible service!!! Read the terms of service because they state that Dolly doesn't carry any responsibility for the encounter with helpers. I moved a couple of weeks ago, and one of the helpers bumped my furniture into the door frame, taking a piece of the frame and paint. Dolly refused to cover the damage, stating that they don't pay for the damage to the environment. This is terrible! If you read closely, the terms of service, Dolly merely positions itself as a \"connector\", connecting you with helpers. They do not carry ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR HELPERS ACTIONS. That's just crazy.",
      "They drivers came late way past their window. There was no communication, and we weren\u2019t able to schedule a time or reschedule a pickup. Ended in cancellation. Terrible. Would never recommend this service to anyone.",
      "I booked a Dolly service to bring back some auction items from an auction house about 30 minutes away from our house. The Dolly app said the driver picked up the items to be delivered for 3 PM. At 3 PM we checked and the items said they had been delivered at 2 PM, but nobody had ever showed up. We have called Dolly three times and they keep telling us they will call us back\u2026 but it\u2019s now been hours and we\u2019ve heard from nobody. as far as I can tell, I just paid somebody $100 to steal my stuff. Never again!",
      "I just moved into a bigger apartment so I have needed help to move items in to furnish it. Within one week, I had two bad Dolly experiences. \nThe main flaw with Dolly is that they pair helpers together who don\u2019t know each other and there is often miscommunication on their end about when a job starts, what kind of vehicle is needed, etc. I booked two different Dolly jobs that required two people and I only had one show up at the agreed upon time. I was supposed to get a couch moved but had to cancel. They have a bad system for communicating between helpers that causes confusion and lack of accountability. Will not be using again.",
      "Have you waiting all day to then cancel",
      "Setup dolly to move a kitchen island.  I included photos and a detailed description of the countertop size with exact length, width and thickness dimensions.  When crew showed up they said it was too big and immediately drove off.  Dolly charged the full amount including the fee I paid for damage protection, even though they did not move anything.  Overseas customer service was useless.  They just read from canned scripts and were no help.  They said US based customer service is not an option.\n\nBuyer beware!!",

      "My delivery was scheduled for 1130 this morning. The driver keeps giving me excuses for being late, I can\u2019t contact customer support. There is only an automated question and answer bot. Refund policy is brutal. \nThere is no refund if I cancel, even though the driver hasn\u2019t shown up.",
      "movers force you to carry heavy items as a customer even though this is a moving service. \n\ncustomer service is unacceptable.",
      "Jobs on this site get listed for a low as $4 and most are around 30 bucks with long drives in between. It seems to me the people behind this app have never been in the moving business with rates this low. Even $100 for a 2 bedroom move with no time limit is very low! \n\nThen they tell you once a job is confirmed and cancelled the same day of the move you get 100% pay but I was confirmed on a job then the job was cancelled same day, and they are saying the system did it and they won\u2019t pay me! That\u2019s very inconsiderate of my time and schedule. If you cancel a job they will charge you $30 but if they cancel\u2026 it\u2019s free and they don\u2019t care how it affects your schedule! Save your time and go with the other moving app.",
      "Had a time slot booked for 10-11 am for a heavy item pick up. Sent two text messages to customer service as I noted that no helper had been assigned to the job. At 10:30 am a customer rep calls to inform me that the job cannot be completed in the time frame and that it will be delayed. I asked if there was a discount given the delay and he said no. Canceled it. Caused great inconvenience to both me and the lady whose home where the item was supposed to be picked up as we had rearranged our schedules to do thus. Utter waste of time and inconvenience and no apology for their inability to do this. Why promise a time frame if you can\u2019t deliver? Your entire business model is built on that. This was my first time using them and definitely my last!",
      "Booked my time for 5-6 stilll not confirmed I had a great experience with them in the past . But now screw this I want my money back now",
      "They allow their helpers to cancel 25 minutes before moving. My helpers cancelled 25 minutes before they were supposed to arrive (even though the scheduled time was 8-9 AM, they cancelled at 8:35 AM.) I would not recommend. The platform is unmonitored. I had a helper text me being very rude and saying that I scheduled this late so I shouldn\u2019t be expecting someone to help\u2014 when in reality, I scheduled this months in advance. Take your business somewhere else.",
      "Driver was late, pick up location had to leave. Transaction had to be cancelled. Currently trying to get my money back. Not satisfied.",
      "They will literally charge you the entire amount if your helper doesn\u2019t do the job. They came but we came to a conclusion that the couch won\u2019t fit they barely touched the couch. If anything I expected partial due to them coming out but 80% is ridiculous.",
      "If I could give a negative review I would. I booked a dolly, paid and got a confirmation of a driver. At my scheduled opening I waited and no one arrived. I went to check the app to message my driver, and it was grayed out. At some point today my Dolly had been canceled. There was nothing in the app to alert me to this. No text to alert me or email. I waited for half an hour on hold to find out what was going on and was told there was nothing they could do. They offered me nothing to make up for the afternoon I took off work to wait no discount. No free delivery. Not even an explanation of what went wrong that I received. Absolutely no notification. I asked for a refund and now I have to wait 48 hours to get the money back in order to schedule with another company. I used to use Dolly all the time and their customer service was excellent. I asked to speak with a manager, and I was told that that was not possible. Ever! It was the most frustrating experience I\u2019ve ever had with a company. Never again.",
      "Booked a Dolly, got charged $128, got an text confirming the booking time. An hour after the booking time, I used the chat feature to get a status update. All the chat feature did was say \u201cI can\u2019t understand your question please rephrase it\u201d or something like that. I then called the customer service line and they told me that there is no one available. I asked them why they accepted the booking and charged me. I got no proper answer. I was asked to change the pick up time, which I never agreed to but they changed it anyway. No one picked up that job either. Then they tried to bully me into switching it to tomorrow.  Then they told me if I don\u2019t switch it to tomorrow they were just going to cancel it anyway. WORST SERVICE EVER! They charge for their service but never provide the service.",

This was so horrible ! I had to run around and found 2 small vans to move my stuff ! It was a horrific experience! I NEED MY MONEY BACK!!",
      "I\u2019m so disappointed and sad that my dolly was cancelled the day of when I booked 3 weeks in advance.

Contractors should be penalized for telling customers they didn\u2019t prepare their own equipment in advance to be able to support customers.",

I told them I didn\u2019t set the price, I paid what dolly suggested.  They yelled at me, called me unethical and said I was \u201ctaking advantage\u201d and when I showed them the pictures I took they said \u201cwell now that we\u2019re here it\u2019s different\u201d.  \n\nThey said they\u2019d only take some of the items.

This was awful\u2026. Just really really awful.  What a terrible experience.  If the job isn\u2019t something they wanted I wish they wouldn\u2019t have taken it and if they still didn\u2019t want it the job I wish they would have let me just cancel.

To tell me EVEN THOUGH I WAS CHARGED and EVEN THOUGH FOR A WEEK WE WERE SCHEDULED FOR 11:00am that somehow it\u2019s not a contract. \n\nThis company is completely useless. Their call center is in India and of no help. They treat customers like idiots and do not respect their time. I will never rely on them again.

They also had dirty hands (which seems strange) and left handprints on the sofa, which the seller sent me a photo of. They asked if I could move the sofa up three flights of stairs in my building and were mad when I said I couldn\u2019t help.

      "No show, no call, no customer service. As far as I\u2019m concerned, this is basically a scam operation. I used them once a year ago and had a good experience, but it is a gamble. I had to have my credit card company refund me.",
      "If I could give them a 0 star I would. I scheduled an appointment a week in advance, only for Dolly to cancel the day of. After speaking with customer service, no accommodations were made and the customer support staff was very rude and did not help reschedule.  This was the worst experience with a move I\u2019ve ever had. Please use someone else more reputable for your moving needs.",
      "Booked my mover weeks in advance and they cancelled 5 minutes after they were supposed to be there. They booked me another mover for 30 minutes later. When that mover did not arrive after 3 hours later, I called dolly and they said they could reschedule me. They have cost me so much time and money and ruined all the logistics of moving that took weeks to set up. Massive headache.",
      "Twice - most unreliable company. Using in LA.",
      "Poor customer service. No resolve just rude agent.",
      "I used the app today to schedule a delivery of a refrigerator. The order seemed to go through. However, I came to find out that it was canceled. However, the app did not tell me it was canceled. So I waited all day until I decided to call customer service. When I called customer service, they told me that there was a fraud alert on my account. Therefore the order was canceled, but as I stated earlier, that cancellation was not noted in the app. when I asked to clear up the fraud situation, they said they could open a ticket and that the team responsible for clearing that up would be in contact with me. When I asked if that would be done today, they could not tell me or confirm that my order would be fulfilled in time. So I tried to cancel the order via the app and oddly enough, the app told me that it was in a \u201cincorrect state\u201d. I suspect that means that the system was flagging it is canceled, but the app wasn\u2019t showing it as such. Overall, this was a bad user interface experience and an even worse customer service experience. I wasted four hours waiting on my order to be fulfilled. I used Lugg instead and got a response within minutes. It was my first time using Lugg also.",
      "Dolly zero stars:\n\nDolly does not tell you there\u2019s a chance nobody shows up, instead it says \u201cWe Got You Covered\u201d in their app even if they don\u2019t. They do not warn in advance that they don\u2019t guarantee someone to show up either. \n\nSchedule a pickup from a retail store, to be delivered to a home. Time of appointment and no \u201chelper\u201d assigned, I figured let me see if this is going to be a problem. I didn\u2019t see anything about this being a broker, or a broadcast service where it\u2019s up to someone to accept the job\u2026 yet it is. \n\nCan\u2019t rely on Dolly to show up, unlike other services they\u2019ll be there on schedule.\n\nCustomer service 0 stars.",
      "I have used this service 4 times without issue, 3 times for moves and once for a clinch delivery. The last time I used the app the worker showed up late, didn\u2019t move anything said he had to step out to make a call and left. The second worker I booked never showed. If you have issues during the service you cannot get anyone on their support line, you can only leave messages. You have to email. I emailed the company and was told the service and charges would be cancelled. When the charges posted to my account, I contacted the company again and was told it was cancelled on their end and I would need to contact my bank if it\u2019s showing a card. They then sent in fraudulent information to make bank saying the service was complete and that I never contacted customer service. They only sent part of the text conversation I had with the helper and cut off the part where I told him I was cancelling the service. When I went back to the app the whole thread was deleted. Like I said, I used them in the past without issue but the one time I had an issue they resorted to bad business practices and fraud. I would avoid using this app ever again.",
      "Don\u2019t use this app, get a professional moving company.\n\nI scheduled an apartment move over a week in advance. The people they sent me were loud and obnoxious tweakers. After getting into an argument with an old lady that they blocked in with their truck they up and left because they were to \u201cmad\u201d and \u201cscared\u201d (by some 85+ y/o Asian lady) that they couldn\u2019t complete their job. Then I scheduled a second move with this company since I was running out of options. They cancelled on me without warning 5 minutes before they were supposed to show up. I understand that these \u201chelpers\u201d are not the exact fault of the company, but dear god if you are going to let these people use your platform and be your voice outside of your office then you need to do better background checks. If I don\u2019t get my money back within 3 days for TWO failed services then I will be issuing a chargeback on my credit card.",

The pick up time came and went without so much as a phone call or a text message to tell me they had canceled, I literally had to open the app and dig around to find the canceled order.  I will not be using Dolly again. I don\u2019t recommend anybody use dolly. It is a very poorly run app that is completely unreliable.",
      "We had booked the dolly for 135$ online to do a pick up. They never contacted me until the day of delivery. They said that the price was wrong because of a system glitch and it should have been 190$. I canceled the order. This is not how a company should work",
      "Worst customer service experience ever. Took $900 and cancelled my second reservation without a refund. Unable to speak with a supervisor or manager \u2014 use a local mover in your community as they charge more than $150+ than what your mover is actually paid. Horrible experience 0/10, wouldn\u2019t recommend.",
      "There are many apps like this, but I decided to try a new one for a simple move of 1 item from my storage. First, helpers can message you to do a pick up outside your preferred window, but the app doesn\u2019t update the time to reflect that. I had a window of 8:30-12:30 and he asked for a 3:30 and wouldn\u2019t be late as I had a hard stop. Well, at 4pm still not here and when messaged said I\u2019ll be there in like 20. The app to cancel charges you 80% if you don\u2019t want to reschedule, so now I have to dispute with my card. Not worth it because when it doesn\u2019t work it really doesn\u2019t work.",

This was the worst experience EVER!!! \u2639\ufe0f",
      "My dolly was \u201creassigned\u201d at the last minute causing over 4 hour delay. Then one of the 2 helpers left midway. I was charged anyway, and then the other helper refused to confirm canceled extension so I was charged additional $160. When escalated they charged my card another $360. This was supposed to be a $200 job that has cost me $720. FRAUD",

I and my friend told that we will help for lifting . But still they cancelled and charged $200. Without service this app charged . It is very unethical and unprofessional. I n ver suggest to anybody.",
      "Literally never experienced anything so miserable. They won\u2019t answer customer support.",
      "I was disappointed with the recent Dolly service I had. Not only did they leave a scratch on my wall with the couch that they removed, they left a long 6 foot scratch on the wall, where it was moved to. They worked so fast that I didn\u2019t get a chance to see these until after they had long after they had left. And after I had paid a tip. \n\nmy advice: please double check your house after something has been moved and double check the location to where it was moved. There could be scratches there could be problems.",
      "They literally canceled after they were already 4 hours late. They then dropped the ball and didn\u2019t find any replacement. Leaving us to find someone else last minute. I do not recommend at all!",
      "Very poor customer service. \n\nI\u2019ve had furniture severely damaged and after submitting documents, photos, receipts I was awarded less than 10% of the purchase price.  \n\nTheir customer service is rude and robotic.  \n\nSome movers are excellent others are awful.",
      "Beware\u2014 they will let you book a work order and nowhere when booking do they mention that any item over 300lbs they WILL NOT move and when the helpers arrive they call Dolly and they\u2019ll cancel the work AND then charge you 100% cancellation fee. The weight limit is hidden in the FAQs but should be more visible when booking. I selected that the item I needed moved was an industrial refrigerator, I included pictures and the brand and dimensions and yet they still sent helpers knowing it would just be cancelled. I threatened to dispute the charge and involve lawyers and then an hour later they removed the fee.",
      "2 guys showed up, Although they were very nice, they showed up with a broken truck and  A lift gate that did not work. \nThey dropped  the freezer twice, could not lift our furniture into their truck and now Dolly is still trying to charge me. \n\nI can not get 1 English speaking person and  he phone and they refuse accept my dispute!! Worst company ever! \n\nWorst part. I still need all the furniture moved!",

      "I booked a dolly and a couple of hours had to cancel. The cancellation was due to a family emergency at the pick up destination. Called customer service and explained what had happen and the agent that answer the phone stated they had to charge 85$ for the cancellation fee. I was shocked why???!  it was placed two hours prior totally unexpected and unacceptable requested to speak to a supervisor and was told I didn\u2019t have that option that I would receive an email maybe a call . I was charged the 85$, to make things worst I go to use my credit card and the charges continue to be pending on my account ! As of yet no email no phone call . Agent was extremely rude and so unprofessional. Contacting the department of consumer affairs to file a complaint. I am a blogger so I will inform the public about this as well!!",
      "Horrible customer service . They cancel on you last minute .",
      "I wouldn\u2019t use this app ever again! The whole experience was such a bad and stressful situation thatI wouldn\u2019t ask for it again. I reserved two movers for 6 hours, the lead one called the day before and said that his rate is high and dolly doesn\u2019t pay them enough. Then left us in a state of confusion if he is showing up or not, we were very stressed since had to move out on the last day of our rental agreement. Anyhow, I called him and convinced him to show and I will pay them extra. The day of the move they both showed up, but nagging the whole time. The other mover smelled alcohol the whole time,  I think he was drinking whenever he had a chance since the whole six hours he smelled like alcohol.  Anyway, the moving was extremely stressful and I just was not able to get in touch with dolly customer service due to long wait time. Never use this service unless you want a great deal of stress in your moving day.",

      "For just a local move 2 miles away and about 4 large items it was quoting me $860 dollars. Called a local mover and got everything it was $260 out the door. Absolutely ridiculous pricing here.",
      "I used moving help only and the helpers were very nice. The main helper showed up just coming from the lake and was not happy to be working, but carried on anyway and was very nice. He was not dressed appropriately as he was in sandals and lake clothes. I thought everything went well as everything was being loaded into some U-Haul U-Boxes to be stored for a couple months. Come to find out when they were unloaded that there was damage to some of my belongings, not due to being transported to and from the U-Haul storage facility but due to the way they were handled by the moving helpers. As I was removing items I saw how things were placed in the U-Boxes and it was obvious to me there was no care taken in how my items were placed. Big example is that a 2 recliner couch was placed on top of my washing machine and the washing machine was broken due to the weight of the couch. I was furious and submitted a claim right away. After providing damage photos and even a photo of the one helper that was obviously still in lake mode the claim was denied due to liability coverage doesn\u2019t apply to labor only moving help. I work in disputes and even my manager would have given an exception to that liability policy due to the circumstances. Just amazing how this company operates. It\u2019s okay to have an employee who shows up to a job in lakeside clothing and shoes and destroy clients items and just wash their hands of it. I did look in my storage containers before I locked them to make sure everything was okay, but as my items were packed I wasn\u2019t able to see certain things and missed the biggest problem that my couch was sitting onto my washer. I would never recommend this company to even my worst enemy.",
      "Highly suggest you go with a different company",
      "I paid for a $10,000 damage protection policy. I received $100 of it which is not even 7% or the damage on a single broken piece of furniture. The movers were also 2 hours late, rude, and the customer service was horrid. All my items were handled with 0 care. Just do yourself a favor and do not use Dolly.",
      "I scheduled a studio apartment move in Boston three weeks+ before my move date. Before I was matched with a helper, someone named Daniel V. messaged me and just said \u201chi\u201d with no further instructions. I was then matched with another helper, who I corresponded with but who had to cancel because he needed to pick up his kids. I was later paired with Daniel V., who I messaged with up until my move date and let him know I got a parking permit for his truck. The next day, when the movers were 30 minutes late, I called and messaged, and Daniel responded that he could not do the job unless Dolly adjusted his payout. I later learned that Dolly adjusted payouts for helpers because it was a busy time in my city, but I guess this helper wasn\u2019t getting that. However, instead of contacting Dolly, he did not answer their calls or mine, and he did not cancel the job, which meant I couldn\u2019t be matched with a new helper. PLUS Dolly support insisted that it was my fault that he didn\u2019t show up because I had selected the wrong size vehicle. I had scheduled a pick up truck because I only had 3 larger items (not even a couch) and was only moving 2 blocks away. I was stranded on my moving day because this is a poorly run company that does not pay their helpers fairly, and the helpers are trying to get as many jobs as they can (understandably) and don\u2019t have time to follow up with customers because they\u2019re busy doing other jobs. They also have horrible BBB reviews. Take your money elsewhere.",
      "I had two movers damage my property,  which I did receive a refund for. 7 months later I decided to use dolly again to move a few pieces of furniture since they were coherent in giving me a refund for my damaged property. After I scheduled the appointment, I got an email saying that I was banned. When I asked why, they refused to give me an explanation and said my account was suspected for fraud. I demanded to know why I was banned and I was told that it was because I had a chargeback\u2026. So not only was my property damaged but I was being punished for it. Such a low blow and so unprofessional for what I thought was a good company. Very disappointed. Save your hard earned dollars on a respectable company.",

My Dolly told me that he couldn\u2019t come at my schedule time and that we can try for another time. The new time rolls around and I hear nothing from him, only for him to text me at the new time he supposed to arrive that someone took it.\n\nThis cost me six hours of an afternoon, and I have yet to receive my items.",
      "Do NOT use Dolly. My \u201chelper\u201d never showed up at the agreed time and blocked my number. Dolly was unable to address the situation or find another helper. Dolly took the stressful experience of moving and made it so so so much worse.",

Then, when we paid and tipped they made us feel horrible for tipping on the app and not giving them cash. We will never use dolly again. Extremely unprofessional.",
      "This was a small move of one piece of furniture within a ten mile radius. They tacked on a separate delivery fee ($28) for distance (?). \nThe first day they changed the pickup time 3 times (a 6  hour window) and finally canceled. Then they gave me a morning slot for the following day. They could not fulfill this request either. After waiting 2 hours, I asked them to return my money. \nMight be a good concept but poorly managed.  They can\u2019t guarantee that someone will take the job so you can wait forever.",
      "I scheduled a Dolly which they assigned me a person, and the day of move I had no communication. The Dolly never showed up and I was forced to cancel. The fustrating part is they charge you to cancel, and one of the options is literally \u201cmover didn\u2019t show up.\u201d So they bascially know the Dolly won\u2019t show up and then charges for a cancellation when it\u2019s their fault. I called support and there was no help as it\u2019s some team in India. I also emailed them and was just told, \u201csorry for the inconvenience.\u201d They are just out here scamming people left and right. Don\u2019t go with Dolly!!!",
      "I booked two months ahead. All seemed fine. Had communication with my lead even the night before. Then the morning of suddenly a new team. Asked if they could start the move an hour late we spoke all seemed fine. 20 minutes later I get a cancellation notice from dolly that they are relisting and they randomly assigned a time 3 hours later. That person would not confirm they would show up. So I find another company and canceled as I HAVE to move today and dolly still charged me their fee which is fraud. I am going to report to consumer fraud in both California where they are based and my state. The attorney general should know what they are doing.",

A helper will be assigned to your dolly before it is scheduled to start\u201d however, no helper was ever assigned to our Dolly. Took time off of work to be there for a delivery that never came. I called and rescheduled for the next morning and again no helper was assigned to my order. As the store I purchased from would only hold the item for two days it was too late too keep waiting around and we were forced to go a different route. Will not be using dolly again.",

      "I give 0 starts not worth of giving 1star as well\nIts very bad customer service and they don't have control on the app or labor. Support just simply sits in india and thinks they will controls everything. They canceled my dolly as the labor didn\u2019t show up on the day of my move. I have ever seen such kind of fake customer support. Please never try to book services from this. They just created this app to steel money and waste our time in moving",
      "Was made aware of the gross pay disparities. The service wasn\u2019t inexpensive and the workers are receiving an abysmal 30% of the total cost. Absolutely wrong considering they are the backbone and labor of this service. Please hire elsewhere.",
      "Upon finding out my Dolly was cancelled two hours before my scheduled move, I contacted customer support to figure out why. They informed me that my account had been banned (with no explanation as to why) and that I had to go through an appeals process to reinstate my account. I asked them how long the appeals process would take and the representative would not give me an answer. As this product doesn\u2019t do the one thing it\u2019s intended to, I definitely would not recommend it and will not be using it in the future.",

      "My movers are two hours late due to a flat tire. I don\u2019t blame them for that in particular but they weren\u2019t great with communication and updating me on ETA. Furthermore, I only have the loading dock reserved for a few hours. So I called customer service to ask if they had any mitigation plan or compensation and they said no. They said they can only raise a complaint. Moving is stressful as is but it\u2019s infuriating that customer service isn\u2019t of any help in situations like this.",

This lack of follow through really put us in a bad position, especially with a time sensitive move. Absolutely no excuse for the lack of respect and organization shown towards its repeat customers. Word of mouth can be a damaging thing, especially with all the choices in digital service apps. I won\u2019t be fooled again. Thanks for adding to the stress of moving Dolly!",

Dolly will not cover the broken dresser. The movers were sloppy. Of course this is my singular experience with 1 set of movers however don\u2019t be fooled, you get what you pay for.

      "I booked a Dolly to transport a dining table from a home in Chicago to a home in the suburbs. First I got a confirmation and then I was informed that the helpers canceled. Then I got a second confirmation with a new team and then they didn\u2019t show up at the appointed time. I called customer support and was informed that the helpers denied the job. I now have to find a U-Haul and do the moving myself. This was a very disappointing experience, and I will not be using Dolly again.",
      "Terrible experience. Used this for an item off Facebook marketplace, scheduled a day in advance. No helper was assigned for the time slot, called support, was told there was nothing they could do and to just schedule for later. Lost the item and my deposit.\nAbsolutely do not recommend this service if scheduling matters at all to you. If you have limitless time and zero plans for as long as they need, then sure, maybe it works.",
      "20 minutes before moving we had one guy no show.",
      "Booked Dolly to pick up and dispose of an old patio slider.  No show and no explanation.   Very poor communication",
      "Had a guy come to help move us out of our house and he was very rude, yelled and argued with me about how long it took and then stole our dolly. \n\nTerrible service and will never use again",
      "No after hours support and can\u2019t cancel despite multiple requests.",
      "The first time I used Dolly their movers out holes in our walls, broke furniture and gouged the hardwood. They don\u2019t have adequate infrastructure to address the claim I made. No response from them after the initial filing. When I call their support number, its just farmed out to another country with no actual corporate contact or presence. We\u2019re out thousands.",
      "I booked Dolly for a simple \u201clabor only\u201d move. All I needed was an extra pair of hands to bring the washer dryer down the steps. It turned out to be an absolute nightmare. I specific that we had one staircase and everything that would be needed to complete the jobs. All we got were two totally unprepared and careless kids who showed up TWO hours late and attempted to CARRY the washer dryer down the full staircase with no moving straps and damage everything on the way down. My walls, paint, stair railing and floors are all damaged due to the carelessness of these \u201chelpers\u201d, who actually did not help at all. Now Dolly has me submit all the photos and wait THIRTY days for a response to my damage claim. Oh, and they will not issue me a refund for this terrible job.",
      "Unfortunately it looks like Dolly is no longer a good moving service. They used to be great, I had used them a couple times, but as some other comments have mentioned recently their service is now pretty bad. We had a dolly scheduled and then they cancelled 5 minutes after they were supposed to arrive. No other dolly was able to be rescheduled making our planned move a lot more difficult. The app was confusing to use in the first place, and the customer service wasn\u2019t all that helpful. At least they gave us a full refund.",
      "Dolly is a nightmare.\n\nAfter booking a delivery service for a couch weeks in advance, on the day of the delivery, Dolly\u2019s assigned workers showed up at my sellers house and took the couch into her doorway, and then abandoned the project. \n\nThey marked it as complete in the app, I never received my couch, and my seller was left in a dangerous situation with her door blocked.\n\nI called customer support all day explaining the urgent issue and no one helped. I was given the same script every time I called and no real support, or even hung up on.\n\nIt still hasn\u2019t been resolved. I paid for a couch and delivery service \u2014 the couch is now being stolen or destroyed by weather sitting outside, and I never received it or the service I paid for. \n\nTheir phone service and website is a hack \u2014 they seem to be intentionally misleading customers and not trying to help. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t want anyone else to use this service and have the same experience.",
      "I scheduled a move 3 weeks ahead. I exchanged messages with a helper the night before. In the morning the helper cancelled 30 min before the move. I had everything packed. I have 2 small children who had to sleep on a plastic covered mattresses for 2 days because I couldn\u2019t find another mover. Terrible service! Avoid at all costs!",
      "They rip off the workers and the customers. Would never use them again.",
      "These movers tried to dictate the start of my move from my storage unit to my apartment. My move was scheduled for 11:30am to coincide with the building\u2019s guidelines and they requested to begin at 8:00 am. They arrived early and we had a couple of heated exchanges once they arrived at the apartment building and had to wait until the appropriate time to enter. These were the most unprofessional movers that I\u2019ve ever hired and it\u2019s making me question whether to use Dolly\u2019s services again.",
      "If you want the most stressful move of your life, then go with this app. This app is not only fraudulent, but they make you jump through hoops to: speak with an agent, have proper equipment show up - maybe a truck when you pay for it? The mover they sent showed up in a 2-door car. To be honest, I felt bad for the mover. His app also showed that I ordered MOVER+TRUCK. After myself & the mover called customer service, they instantly changed the app on BOTH myself and the mover. It was wild. Good thing for email receipts!! Negative stars.",
      "That\u2019s cancelled last minute and never rescheduled.  When I called and waited several minutes on hold, the operator disconnected the call.  Horrible first experience!",
      "That\u2019s all i can say HORRIBLE",
      "Never confirmed driver prior to window, no contact made to customer.  Disappointed.",
      "Dolly app is not transparent on the services they allow and don\u2019t allow. They make their money based on stealing through the \u201ccancellation fee\u201d. This is unprofessional and straight up robbery! Don\u2019t use this app! I would leave zero stars if it there was an option!",
      "terrible experience",
      "You do not have a guarantee of service. Too many stairs? The movers will cancel. Too far of a move? The movers will cancel. As confirmed by several workers who\u2019ve contacted me through the app. The census shows that the movers are NOT incentivizing through pay. Cheap pay = workers who will screw your over for any inconvenience. Do not use this app",
      "My direct arrived and was not friendly, complained immediately about there being more than one flight of stairs. There was one flight, but just broken into two staircases. It was me and him doing the move and he was not friendly when he instructed me on how to move it. \n\nHe then asked me how I would fix that there was more than one staircase. I priced it on the app, and it was $5 more for one more flight. \n\nI was very frustrated by this service and ended up moving the cushions and putting the couch together on my own, because I didn\u2019t want to work with him. \n\nAlthough I was dissatisfied with his service, It sounds like he gets 40% of the payment, and that isn\u2019t sufficient, so I think customers need to know that.",
      "The movers were great but if you overbook time they will steal from you.",
      "I\u2019d give them zero stars if I could. Extremely unprofessional. The morning of my move I as notified that the movers assigned would no longer be coming and that no back up is provided. The customer service team lied about the whole process and then provided no support on the day I was required to move. Avoid at all costs.",
      "Worst moving experience of my life! I DO NOT RECOMMEND this company! I am a single mother with a young child. The movers were 1) Late! and 2) LEFT A KING-SIZED HEADBOARD LOOSELY DANGLING FROM MY STAIRWELL!!! The claims group first said they would only reimburse approximately $400 for the bed and $500 for environmental damages. They wanted estimates which I obtained. The estimates to repair the damage to my floors, walls, ceiling and head board totaled over $9,000. Dolly then came back and said they would only reimburse $500 total for the damages despite additional insurance coverage I paid for. I paid $375 to move ONE bed and they caused thousands of dollars of damage to my property. \n\nThe movers refused to take the headboard over an outside railing to get it to a 2nd floor bedroom. Instead they insisted upon taking it up a rounded interior hallway that is too narrow. After they got the headboard STUCK they said they were too tired to try to move it anymore and had to leave it because they were late for another job! \n\nI had to PAY FULL PRICE FOR A SECOND MOVE IN ORDER TO GET THE HEADBOARD OUT OF MY STAIRWELL! The second movers came in the evening and didn\u2019t want to assemble the bed even though it was clearly stated in the purchase order. \n\nThey said they were too tired and would have to come back the following day to assemble the bed. The next day, they couldn\u2019t assemble the bed using basic nuts, washers, and bolts. They tried to steal the washers to cover up their errors. As I was questioning where the washers went and looking diligently on the floor, one of the movers dropped a washer from his pocket, as though I didn\u2019t notice, and claimed it had been there the whole time. Then, the second movers WOULD NOT LEAVE MY HOME WITHOUT PAYMENT FOR TIP!! I paid an additional $60 to get them to leave without further damaging my property or harming me.",
      "Three days in advance we booked a dolly + two helpers for one easy move of under 30 min total.   Got confirmation of order and immediately charged, but this service was unable to provide anyone.   Waited until two hours into our three hour window, contacted support and was advised to maybe pick a different time or day!  We never did get any movers so\u2026   Unacceptable service\u2026 canceled request  three hours ago \u2026  still see no refund!   \n\nAlso overpriced.  checked local movers for same service \u2026$75-$90.   Dolly charged me $126 after a $106 estimate!!  \n\nLook elsewhere.",
      "Mover delayed last minute. No communication .",
      "This app and service is terrible.  I need items picked up and they have already missed the delivery day and I will lose paid for items",
      "App got me all the way to booking then failed.  Tried several times.  Huge waste of time.",
      "I could not have done it without them. Excellent service and concern for my belongings. Will use them again if the need arises.",
      "Do not ever use this service!!!!! I requested moving assistance and booked a job. When they arrived they began a lengthy disagreement with me because the movers didn\u2019t want to move my items until I paid more than the agreed upon price. Finally they began moving the first item and as soon as they got to the stairs they bobbled it, dropped it, and shattered the glass. And Dolly refuses to pay the claim I made on the glass repair! The movers were argumentative and insulting. And also incompetent. Additionally they kept saying they were only getting $20 for this move and I was paying $200- so they get a very small cut of the fee and are not interested in doing a good job.",
      "I had the absolute worst experience with this app and would recommend any of the other apps or even a moving company over them. I booked them two weeks out and everything was fine and verified until they cancelled less than 12 hours before the booking. Then instead of even an apology they said they would find me new movers and didn\u2019t get back to me until after the time of my booking had passed. I ended up using the Thumbtack to find someone else at a reasonable price and I figured it out. Do yourself a favor and just use thumbtack or literally anything else.",
      "First time using app. Easy to set up and book. Couch arrived a few minutes early. Movers were nice. Then things went downhill. Got a call from the store the next day that they left two pillows at the store. Contacted Dolly customer service where I had to navigate several difficult-to-understand service people who blamed the store for not checking that all pieces were on the truck for delivery. I was looking for \u201cSorry, we\u2019ll have someone swing by and grab those in the next day or two.\u201d",
      "Customer service for help is out of touch, generic and show no empathy or respect for their customers. They send help but ask little to no questions about specific of job or helpers aren\u2019t able to assess the request to see if they have the skills/tools available to perform the job request before they take your money. Their policy is black and white, no consideration for a refund based on a job the helpers could not completed. They charge you high rate and pay works  low wage.  They don\u2019t even refund you their high fees that the are not part of the worker compensation that they don\u2019t pay them. 1st time using the app and Will NEVER use again. BEWARE!!!",
      "I selected one pickup window and somehow another was selected seemingly for me. How to change it turns out to me a knowledge base that is not helpful so I am stuck with a time two hours later. No way to speak to anyone. It\u2019s all app, no way to get a human involved.",
      "No work",
      "My assigned helpers had awful ratings and lived up to it. I left reviews and haven\u2019t been contacted by Dolly.  It\u2019s been almost a week.  So disappointed.",
      "Hired a dolly to deliver some furniture from about 20 minutes away. Took the guy almost 4 hours after he left the location to get to me and dolly says there is nothing they can do about it. My suggestion to anyone is hire a local mover and don\u2019t use this app.",
      "They will deactivate your account for the simplest mistake I got deactivated for being stuck in a 4pm traffic in New York",
      "Had a mover get upset over me asking for a refund because there was only 1 mover and not 2. Politely called Dolly CS, who then refunded me the price for the extra helper. \nThe helper showed up at my house 2 days later to threaten me, and the police had to get involved. I would not recommend this company ever. DO NOT use them ever."

      "Excellent service. Friendly and easy. Will call them again in the future!",
      "I received a quote in the app and after the move when it was time to pay there was an additional base fee that should have been on the original quote. They also have exorbitant by the minute charges if you go over, but of course they don\u2019t refund you if you go under. I\u2019d say this is better than nothing but be very careful. my driver couldn\u2019t get his app to work and seemed kind of out of it but I\u2019ve read that they pay them peanuts.",

      "Wow service!  Very hard working. Energetic and Professional!",
      "I was unable to contact the driver via app and the number available just kept dropping the call. I decided to cancel the service since the package being delivered was in a store and they were about to close. Hence, the need to want to know the exact ETA so I can either wait outside with the package or reschedule for next day. Anyways, I canceled the service on the apps and was charged $40 for services not provided and unable to reach customer service and or the driver. I was hoping for a customer centered experience at the very list.",
      "Very helpful App! Good customers support also",
      "Excellent service!  Will use again and highly recommend!",
      "The app is so easy to use and self explanatory. The delivery driver that was assigned to us, Eli, was courteous and let us know what was going on with our delivery every step of the way.",
      "The app isn\u2019t bad but should require a picture so the delivery person knows exactly what is being delivered. Also, HomeGoods recommends this app for delivery items so better coordination with them and other vendors",
      "Wonderful service     Very helpful.  We were able to purchase a sofa and get it delivered SAME DAY!    Worth the money and very professional service.  Did not know about this  service before today.   Glad to know about it now.",

      "I requested 2 helpers for 2 hours, only 1 showed up. It was difficult to contact customer support. I eventually was called back, she put me on hold to \u201c contact her manager\u201d then I was disconnected. 2 hours after the first helper showed up, they sent another guy out but the job was done by my son, daughter and one go-share helper. Go-Share charged me the entire price quoted for 2 helpers. Do not use this App!! They will rip you off!",
      "First off, both gentlemen that helped me with my project were great!  Professional, great service, and got the job done.  On the other hand this app charges way too much.  I would not recommend to family and  friends solely due to charges being too high.  The estimate you first receive is not the final price, please keep that in mind.",
      "What a great service to discover!  We\u2019ll use you folks again!",
      "I bought a sofa off of facebook marketplace,   but it was heavy, so before paying for it I had to figure out how to move it, and get it up a flight of stairs.  The app was easy to use and figure out, it was easy to add a second \u201chelper\u201d for the move.  Really liked the up front pricing.  Factored that into the total cost and bought the sofa.  The two guys that showed up were great, and showed up (separately) in 30 and 40 mins.  \n\nIt did take a few minutes to get signed up, but next time should not have to do that.",
      "I don\u2019t have a large car nor the expertise to move heavy items through tight areas. I was worried after seeing some reviews about customer service, but my rep was super helpful and quick to solve a small scheduling problem. As for the movers themselves, I\u2019m very satisfied, and they kept me informed about their arrival and status! They really saved me a ton of time and effort.",

He also sent me a photo of the damaged item.  I told him not to pick up.  Very impressed that he thought enough to call me - avoiding a return charge.  In addition, the other items that I ordered were delivered with care and in a timely manner.  That is great customer service. Very reasonable prices.  Will definitely use GoShare again.",
      "This is a great service.  I am alone and no man or truck now l have both from this app ! A way to get new furniture that l fall in love with !",

      "I was recommended this app from a department store selling heavy furniture. I was surprised how quickly the guys arrived and delivered once we requested a pickup (within the hour). It was incredibly easy to get a free quote and you can tip from the app. I have zero complaints and would definitely use again!",
      "Both pros were excellent. Came on time. Did everything professionally. Very honest. Everything he did with a smile. The whole experience was so smooth.  Reasonable pricing.",

      "Super fast! On time and professional!!",
      "Fast and efficient service!",
      "Today I discovered GoShare. I purchased an piece of antique furniture on FB Marketplace and was disappointed to discover that the piece could not be dismantled to fit in my SUV. As the seller was moving, I needed to secure delivery quickly.  \n\nI found GoShare online. Its like Uber for deliveries.  \n\nUsing the app, i entered the pick up and delivery locations, details and a photo of the furniture. A driver picked up the job in less than 5 minutes. \n\nI received a text notification from GoShare letting me know the project had been assigned.  I had a few more details to relay. Jason replied quickly letting me know the information would be relayed to the driver. I was impressed that a real person handled the information.  \n\nThe delivery was successful. The driver communicated all steps of the project and delivered the furniture safely. \n\nUpon delivery, drivers mark the end of the project, and take a photo of the delivered item. This is saved in the app for your records.  \n\nThe app is easy to use, indicates progress, handles payment and tips efficiently.  Users can see an itemized break down of the final charges before paying.  \n\nThere is a charge if the delivery takes longer than expected.  My project did take longer as the driver encountered traffic. \n\nI was happy with my GoShare experience and will use the service again!",

      "Like seriously, nothing in life works out this easy. My husband hurt his back moving and just to see what the costs would be to have it moved for us oh a whim through another app I\u2019ve used before- I saw this one and decided to get a quote. Literally from idea to Michael being at our house and loading up was less than an hour. This service was not just affordable, convenient, and quick- our guy Michael was awesome. I am taking time out of moving to write this review that\u2019s how happy we are with our experience. The cost of service was exactly what we were quoted and Michael even got here and started early. 10/10!!!!!",
      "Great service, professional people. I don\u2019t think I can get a better delivery service than goshare.",
      "Go Share was exactly what we needed to get a purchase we made moved to our place. Such a useful and convenient service when you don\u2019t have access to a larger cargo or moving truck. Will definitely use Go Share again!",
      "Both guys were great Movers. Listen well no damage very considerate. It\u2019s the best experience I\u2019ve ever had moving and I move every year. The other moves have sucked. This one\u2019s the best. I can\u2019t believe how great they are. I\u2019m not able to move things myself. I was very grateful for their strong backsand we had to go up and down a lot of stairs. No worries these guys were strong. I could go on for hours how great they are also very reasonable I wouldn\u2019t call anyone else.",
      "The reservation was easy to make over the phone. The representative helped me as much as he can, because he was sick, he had a hard time talking. I appreciate his time, and he answered all my questions as a first time customer. I wasn\u2019t frustrated or got annoyed by him, sometimes it happens to new company.\n\nI told him I need a pickup at 4pm (when I called at 3pm) and he submitted that request in the database, however, this guy who decided pick up my delivery at Costco was commuting 1.25 hours away from MD to winchester so he arrived at 4:40pm. These drivers bring their own vehicles and maybe driving from somewhere far away or local so\u201dcan\u2019t be accountable on exact time\u201d. \n\nMy 2nd problem that I came across is that the white van that show up wasn\u2019t a \u201ccargo vehicle\u201d that I reserved so the driver had to make 2 trips and was upset by that. What got to me is that the van was able to hold 2 boxes max -make 2trips-took more time waiting for him to drive back to my house and I was charged for a \u201ccargo vehicle\u201d! \n\nThere were some communication mistakes for sure! However I am thankful that someone was able to help me last minute today and show up less than 2 hours from when I made the reservation.",
      "I bought two recliners which were in stock at Kirkland\u2019s . The store suggested using GoShare for the delivery and it was great! I had the chairs in my home two hours later. Awesome service I will definitely use them again",

      "Ap is super wonderful and the team very prompt and professional.",
      "I bought a new sectional couch at Costco, but didn\u2019t have the truck to bring it home (nor did any friends). Plus as a single older person who is no longer able to do the heavy lifting required to get this monster home, Goshare was my answer!!! The app was really easy to use for same-day (or pre-arranged delivery). I just uploaded pick up and drop off locations, size of vehicle needed, and number number of workers to do the job. I got a free estimate to see if I wanted to purchase (and by the way, the delivery fee rivals any store delivery fee), and done! The service was excellent. Workers came to pick it up and the drop off was seamless. I totally highly recommend this service for any delivery or move.",
      "This was my first time with GoShare. \nIf everyone is like John H, then this company will flourish. \nNot only was he on time but arrived  fully prepared for options of ideas and tools in getting this oversized item into the haus. \nTruly a pleasure. \nThanks John!",
      "I tried first time this app to deliver sofa to my house and it was good experience!!!",

I am definitely going to use GoShare services again.  \n\nThank you, GoShare!",

      "My driver did an excellent job of getting my chairs safely to my home. Will encourage me to buy more at Homegoods!",

      "I used goshare in 2021, great experience. I'm moving again and needed to ship several large boxes. UPS idiot drivers failed THREE TIMES. So i hired goshare again to take the boxes (about 20) to the UPS store, and once again, it was a lovely experience. The drivers are polite and helpful and do their job. Would highly recommend!!! \ud83d\udda4\u2728",
      "If I had to sum it up in one word, it would be effortless. I appreciate it. I was able to create my own \u00e0 la carte based on my needs. I would recommend this service for purchases at Costco, Best Buy, etc. same-day delivery without the extra hidden fees from the store.",
      "This was my 1st time to use GoShare.  It was a last minute pickup/delivery with a 1 hr window.  The app was very user friendly.  I was able to upload photos and my receipt.  \n\nBrian R was my driver.  He was delightful to work with, being on time, pleasant. He took care in the placement of my furniture.  Brian is very professional.  I will recommend him/GoShare to my friends and business associates.  I will use GoShare again.",
      "Awesome app! Works well! Elaborate",
      "The estimate is attractive but they will get you later with actual time",
      "Go Share has our backs, literally helping with the heavy lifting in a professional manner and always on time. We are so grateful to know Go Share is there for us.",
      "Great App and good experience\u2026",
      "Amazing service, fast, professional and friendly!",
      "I was so happy with their service. Works well when the store doesn\u2019t have delivery options. Not cheap but worth it.",
      "I found the app easy to use, the responses, timely, and the detail about the costs very informative. While this was my first experience, it won\u2019t be my last. I will use this app again.",
      "This is the second time I have used GoShare. I highly recommend them and will continue to use their services.",
      "The app was very easy to use and the people who delivered my order were timely, thoughtful and very professional!",
      "Used GoShare today for the first time in a while. Was so impressed that I will definitely be using them again soon. Driver today was professional, on time, considerate and all at a reasonable price. Couldn\u2019t be more satisfied with the service I experienced today. Thank you!",
      "So I\u2019ve never been so happy to have picked up a business card in my life! I was in a furniture store and I saw these business cards. Something told me to get one. Well my movers canceled on me day of and I booked these movers same day! I was so relieved the process was so easy and seamless! The movers were quick, efficient and professional! If I ever need things moves again, I will look no where else! The only thing that would have really made me extra happy was if the movers could dismount my tv unit. But the couldn\u2019t due to policy. Still very happy!!!",
      "Movers didn\u2019t show up. Customer support is chat. No one responded.",
      "My husband and I have used GoShare 4 times now and we have been extremely happy every time.  The service is fast, friendly, convenient, and professional.  Customer service seems to be a lost art in many American businesses but not with GoShare.  Thank you so much GoShare.",
      "Can\u2019t believe how easy it is to all of the support you need!",
      "1st time using GoShare app and was truly impressed with everything about it !\n   I purchased an outdoor door seating set at a Home Goods store in Toms River but they don\u2019t\ndo deliveries. The cashier suggested using the GoShare app for delivery.  I downloaded the GoShare app and entered pickup and delivery addresses,  picked type of truck and put in payment with credit card .\nWithin 30 minutes I received a response from my driver and his eta.  I was blown away that less than 2 hours after purchase, the furniture was delivered at my house. This was a Sunday night !  My delivery driver was the best!    Thank you GoShare !",
      "Excellent service but had a little issue during booking and being rescheduled. Otherwise excellent service",
      "I had no idea about this service. My sons package was delivered to my house by mistake and it had to be delivered to his house today. My car was in the shop and I had so many things going on I couldn\u2019t take his delivery to him. It was his wife\u2019s Mother\u2019s Day gift from the kids so it was imperative he got it today. I did a search online and scheduled my delivery. The gentleman that showed up was very kind and understood that it had to get to my sons house today. He drove it straight there. I am such a happy customer. I look like Mom of the year to my son and he looks like he did an amazing job getting her gift without her finding out. We all win",
      "Can I start today?\nI am excellent driver",
      "This wa our first time using GoShare. We needed a large bench delivered from HomeGoods and they use this outside vendor.  Literally 5min or less after signing up via the app, we got a driver assigned.   We were able to track the status along the way and they sent status alerts too.  The driver was quick and very friendly!  We will definitely use this service again.",
      "Go share is Awesome.",
      "I have used this service 1 time with success and twice with no success. 1st time it took quite a bit of time to find a driver but eventually one was found. \n\n2-3 time over 2 day I out in multiple request for a variety of different vehicles and didn\u2019t get one driver.",
      "Used many times on my iPhone for delivering large items. Great to see that the app works well on a macbook too.",
      "They take entirely to long to process payments, which essentially prevents the drivers from getting paid. Which in turns holds you up from getting the authorization hold off of your account. I had to reach out to the company 3 different times requesting them to process my payment . Super annoying, and I do not recommend this app.",
      "I\u2019m so glad Home Goods referred me to this company. Prices are very reasonable and great service. Not all of us have a pickup or access to one. I would definitely use again",
      "Peter was incredibly professional!  He had our couch wrapped  to make sure it was delivered perfectly! He delimit into our hose and made sure it was perfect!",
      "Had use for delivery and service is nice & easy !",
      "I was able to purchase a sofa today during the holiday sales. I had no idea I would get it delivered within an hour after buying it from the store. I was just blessed today because the sofa I wanted was much more expensive in another store. I was able to purchase at another store that offered same day delivery and I paid less than the cost of the sofa at the other store and got professional same day delivery that was included. The service delivery persons were fast, courteous, professional, and helpful. They took really good care in delivering the sofa as if it were their own. Thank you.\nThe billing on the other hand was poor customer service. Put 2 holds on my account and only one was released when actual bill was paid. The second was a 6 day hold for no reason. I don\u2019t have a contact number to speak to a live person, only a bot. \ud83d\ude21",
      "It is so hard to find a service for moving things either across town or at your home. These guys are professionals, polite and on time. What more could you want?",
      "I didn\u2019t know about you all.  Glad to know you\u2019re here. I will use your services again. Thank you!",
      "I saw a large sideboard I wanted to buy\u2026.\nGot the GoShare App\u2026.. and by 6:00 pm it was delivered to my home.\nFantastic!!!\nThank you.",
      "This s a great solution to your last minute purchases that require heavy lifters (and delivery!!!\ud83d\ude09) Will be my go-to solution",
      "Scott was wonderful\u2026timely, professional, meticulous, and personable!",
      "When I made my major purchase at home sense I was unsure how I was going to get all the items home. Home sense handed me the card. The app was easy to fill out and the guys were extremely nice and efficient.",
      "Georgio was the most experienced professional and polite technician I\u2019ve ever seen. He was very attentive to details and fast. I will definitely request him again. The overall service provided was great!! Thank you again for being such an awesome customer service team.\n\nR.Brown",
      "Excellent and professional. Next time I need your company. Just pray I get the guys. Thank you again \nGrace Koski",
      "I saw industrial strength shelves at CostCo. I really wanted them for my garage but could never have gotten them home & assembled without help. GoShare was there from the moment of purchase! Perfect delivery & setup in record time. Amazing! Many thanks to Kaiser & Jorge!",
      "Outstanding service at a very reasonable rate. Today I had the opportunity to use Goshare\u2019s service and I was blown away. Goshare provides a top notch service that is both practical and efficient. My move involved Goshare employees James and Shirlette. Both were extremely professional, friendly, and courteous. They truly represent what Goshare is aiming to achieve in providing top notch service at reasonable rates by professional drivers and moving personnel. Kudos Goshare!",
      "Fantastic business. Fast service, an excellent worker, perfect for an older person needing help moving product.",
      "All of the movers have been amazing but the app always charges more than they say cost will be at first and they need to improve communication from app side.",
      "I had a great experience with Go Share.",
      "Beyond amazing!!! The guys were on time and most professional. I recommend GO SHARE!!!",
      "Goshare delivery service is an enormous help to my landscape design business.   It\u2019s like having a personal driver or assistant available to help with pick ups and deliveries.  Especially on planting days, sometimes you just need a few more bags of soil or plants that didn\u2019t make the main delivery truck need to be picked up and brought to the job site. This is time efficient and cost efficient.",
      "As usual my experience was great. Always a pleasure and I love the communication.",
      "Staff very friendly and extremely professional.",
      "This was my first time using this app and it was amazing!!  I bought a sectional sofa at HomeGoods and it was in my home within 2 hours of purchase.  I highly recommend!",
      "first time using it. really helpful",
      "I wanted to share my experience and disappointment with this app. I placed a request a week in advance to move a treadmill. The request was for a pickup and helper. When the driver showed up to the address he stated the treadmill will need to be taken apart. I asked where the helper was and he said he is running late. The helper arrived an hour late. I helped the driver with the disassembly. Once apart I helped the driver with moving the pieces to his truck. Just to point out, I\u2019m still recovering from major ankle surgery. The helper arrived when the last piece was being moved. I stil was needed to help as they were not able to lift the piece. When they arrived with the items to my home I simply said to just use the outside entrance to the basement, place the pieces inside and I will take of the rest. Again, I found myself being needed to help with lifting. The personnel that was tasked with the job knew ahead of time what they were moving. The customer should not be tasked with moving the items. Also I was charged overtime for the incompetence of the moving squad. I was offered a $20 discount. The overtime charge should have been waived due to the circumstances.If I did not help with the lifting I\u2019m sure the charge would have been much higher. Will be using another platform for sure with the next project!",
      "Ron was on time, courteous, and very friendly and professional.   I definitely appreciate this type of situation.  Thanks!  :)",
      "UNK H was professional, on time and very helpful moving our credenza. Would definitely use again!",
      "This is the most convenient service & not to mention the gentleman was professional & friendly. He made it a great experience. I was shopping in Home Goods & had lots to purchase for my daughter's new bedroom. I came across three pieces of large furniture & were not going to fit into my SUV & why bother my husband or son with having to travel 35 mins to go pick it up with their truck. Instead, I saw the GoShare sign in Home Goods & downloaded the app, created an account & the guy was there in no time. It was so great all across the board & I cannot wait to use this service again. I'm telling all of my friends & family about this amazing service!!! Thank you GoShare!!!!!",
      "My first time using Go Share. I\u2019m very pleased with everyone involved in the set up, contact info., updates and delivery today.",
      "Was hesitant to use but so glad I did\u2026great service and will use again.",
      "Nicholas was very helpful in setting up my account. He kept us informed along the way about the timing of our delivery. \nDan and the other delivery person did an outstanding job at our home. They were very careful and considerate of our home and the dresser. They carried the it into the bedroom, and they placed it where we wanted it. \nI highly recommend GOSHARE! \nThank you",
      "I was very clear on moving a refrigerator and it\u2019s size. Driver showed up with too small of a truck.",
      "These are not personal issues, but general concerns that should be addressed for all users of the app and service. :\n\nThis is the big one:\nWhen making a reservation, pickup was at a location away from mine. So, I changed the address from my current location to the pickup location. Seeing that I missed entering the unit number,  I went back to add unit # to the address. At that point the app defaulted to change the pickup location to my personal physical location miles away from the actual intended pickup location. I almost didn\u2019t see that it changed automatically.  \nThe app should not change the location that I had entered. The fact that I was in edit mode means that I was handling the addresses - don\u2019t need it to revert to anything.  Perhaps there could be a <use current location> button instead if the intention is for the app o be helpful. Otherwise it\u2019s the opposite of helpful. \n\nPerhaps the issue could be avoided if the unit number had available an \u201caddress line 2\u201d instead of having to be input into the \u201cspecial notes\u201d or \u201cadditional info\u201d  (how ever it\u2019s worded).  My driver didn\u2019t even see that it was in the notes because\n It wasn\u2019t part of the address in the app. \n\nIf I didn\u2019t see that I was reverted, driver would be at the wrong address and would likely cancel, therefor would cost extra, frustrate me and cause delays.\n\nSo, there are two things to change that are  critical to this app: \n1.) the app should not default to current location once a different location was already entered to change it from current location; and\n2.) An \u201caddress line 2\u201d or unit number should be added to the pickup location.\n\nThe app has a glitch in the customer support portion (went to to a blank screen a couple times). \n\nFinally, There is no way to share the app from within the app. I needed to come back to the App Store to share it. Not convenient. If you seriously want us to share your app, then you should make it as easy as possible to do so.  \n\nYou alone have the power to make these changes. \nMake it so. It would be magnificent if the developers actually used the apps they develop. Don\u2019t just go through it as if it was the real thing. Actually use the service. That\u2019s how apps become great.",
      "Excellent service - easy, uncomplicated, on time, personable. We have used the service before and would highly recommend.",
      "Great service. Will definitely recommend and use again!",
      "two very nice gentleman came to bring me my cabinet. They were on time and super friendly. they wrapped it up really well to protect it. will use again.",
      "We had a great experience with the Go Share service. The driver and his helper were very professional. They were timely and very polite.",
      "I used this app for the first time today. I received pickup and delivery within 1hr. I will pay for convenience and that\u2019s exactly what i got. The crew was professional, friendly and helpful. I would definitely use again and recommend to others",
      "I was able to book quickly for exact time I needed. Dan was an awesome delivery dude, personable, quick thinking and gracious. I will use this service all the time.",
      "I love being able to but a new price of furniture and not having to worry about hauling it.",
      "I found a beautiful leather sofa but had no way to transport it.  I found GoShare on line and put in the schedule I wanted.  I really didn't expect anyone to be available.  Seconds after I finished, Stephen L. had accepted my job.  I was shocked!  He went out the same evening to pick up my sofa.  Seeing where he was and the progress on line was so reassuring.  Unfortunately, on his way back to my place, the weather decided not to cooperate.  I called him & he was willing to wait until the storm was over or keep my sofa until the morning.  He had excellent communication with me at all times and since the water was ankle high in front of my door, we decided to finish the next morning.  I was so impressed with his service.  It\u2019s rare to find someone who goes the extra mile to make things work.  Stephen L. did that & more.  I will use GoShare in the future and ask for Stephen L. because I trust him with my purchases.",
      "Driver was a little early, came to home, brought inside , was polite and did a very good delivery.",
      "Booked at the last minute, within an hour and a half window. He arrived on time, early actually. Was polite professional and helpful. I highly recommend this app and request Anil if possible.",
      "We had two men from your service pick up and deliver our furniture from the store.  They were on time and very professional!  We will use your service again!",
      "This was my first time using this app and it was so simple. I was able to upload all the items that I needed moved including pictures. The guys who showed up to help me move were so friendly and fast.I didn\u2019t have much to move but didn\u2019t have a truck and some items were heavy for me. I will definitely be using this app again.",
      "I\u2019ve used quite a few moving service apps and other loading and unloading businesses in the past and most of them were a complete let down. When I stumbled upon GoShare, I had my doubts that this was going to be any different. But today, I was proven wrong. This is overall the BEST moving service app that I\u2019ve ever used! The move was quick, easy and most importantly, the movers showed up ON TIME. This app gots my #1 recommendation for a simple, and easy on the bank, moving service.",
      "This is the second time I\u2019ve used GoShare to move large purchased items the same day. The App is very intuitive and easy to use. The professional service I received exceeded my expectations both times.",
      "We are grateful for the help!",
      "Great app very glad I found it and was very easy to use. Driver showed up on time and was polite and a hard worker. Highly recommend",
      "I would highly recommend this company. Driver and helper we\u2019re on time and very friendly.",
      "I just needed two people for one location and I had to pay as if it was a vehicle needed and add a second location as well.  It wasn\u2019t fair to the workers or myself.",
      "Richard was great.",
      "Usama delivered our outdoor furniture in incredible time\u2014I had barely returned home when he called to say he was ten minutes away. He was organized, respectful, and diligent.  He carefully carried each piece and even helped me place them once on our deck! Because of his work and personality , I will definitely use this service again.",
      "It\u2019s really great there is a service like this since some places don\u2019t deliver. As long as the driver and helpers show up, it\u2019s great. Today went smooth because of the two men who joined the job. Customer service is great too!",
      "This was a simple process and received very quickly. Makes buying a product very simple.\n\nGreat Service lndroa1",
      "I\u2019m so excited! I can buy anything, anywhere any size now, and have it picked up and delivered that day! This app is brilliant! You will love it!",
      "I like the company",
      "This is a fantastic service! Was at Costco and had no way to get the couch I purchased home or down into the basement. It was so easy to schedule people to help with this delivery. It went very smooth!",
      "I learnt GoShare app from Costco. I am a long time Costco member and always trust Costco\u2019s selection. Today for the first time, I used GoShare to move a few pieces of bedroom furniture. First the driver arrived 30 min later than the scheduled appointment time and then it took him 45 min longer than the estimated time by Apple app. Overall the experience is below my expectations.",
      "Fantastic. Before I blinked my eyes! Thanks.",
      "The ease of this app and the friendliest of my movers left me very satisfied. 5 Star! They communicated well, worked hard and cared for my things as their own. I was VERY pleased\u2026until I got my bill. GoShares practice is to CHARGE you a hold, only to charge you again for the movers individually and eventually return the hold in due time. Therefore, you would need to insure you have double the quoted estimate before booking. How that makes sense, not sure.",
      "Every step of the process is comunicated prmptly with  alerts . Very nice .",
      "Dorsey was on his first delivery and was positive, professional and excellent as a driver/delivery lead. He had blankets and the proper gear for the job. Additionally, zack was a great helper!  Well done!!!",
      "What a great service! Was impressed by the people who showed up to do the job. Would definitely use again",
      "These guys were amazing! Thanks much!",
      "Very professional , on time and very helpful. I would recommend them to everyone.",
      "I bought my book case from Home Sense. I needed a way to get it home and they offered this delivery service that could get it to me the same day. I didn\u2019t know it existed and I\u2019m glad it does because now when I get things from Home Sense. Home Goods or others I can hire them and know I can receive the item the same day.",
      "Great concept with very reasonable cost for those times the large items you want to transfer and don't want to impose on your friends or contract a moving company. \n\nVery reasonable, fast & easy.",
      "It was easy to download the app and designated locations. But I had no clue about choosing truck size or several moving equipments. \nI called GoShare and was recommended a cargo van for my items. They were outsized the cargo van. The two men that picked up my project were great. They made the delivery a successful one.\nYes, I will use the service again.",
      "I appreciate the care and professionalism from the customer service to drivers. I will share my experience along about your service. Thank you",
      "These people tricked me into paying much more than I would normally have for furniture delivery only for them to dump it at my home without assembly. When I asked for them to assemble it, they claim order was completed  and shut off our chat group. They have no number to call. If you\u2019re a single mum or someone in need of real assistance, please be careful, once they take the money, you have no way of ensuring you get what you paid for. Please be careful!!!",
      "First time using this app. Purchased a couch that needed delivery from Home Goods, the gentleman who coordinated with the store,  delivered our couch 100% as we bought.  They were professional and Covid safe wearing their masks and booties! We were very happy would definitely recommend this service to anyone.",
      "This app was easy to use and the moved worked out well.",
      "The total price was nearly double the  originally estimate. Not sure who is at fault, GoShare or the driver but the driver had to make two trips instead of 1 because he had a camper top on his truck. I feel like that should have been taken into consideration before he accepted the job. I was not happy with the total price of delivery but appreciate the convenience of the service.",
      "This is my first time using Go Share. I love everything about this experience. The guys were knowledgeable, experienced, efficient, and did an excellent job delivering my bed and assembling it. I\u2019m so pleased! Thank you!",
      "It was my first experience with you guys and wasn\u2019t good at all and I will never use it again and not offer to anyone else. Not good communication and not good customer service and charging unfairly",
      "Previously had trouble moving furniture. This app broke the barrier for me. I was able to hire a professional who showed up immediately to the store , transported my heavy piece of furniture to my house , carried it swiftly and finished the job earlier than expected. Would recommend & use again for sure.",
      "The drivers finished the projects and followed instructions very well.  I was very impressed and happy with their service. However, a leg on the sofa was broken. I was not watching the unloading and had no evidence if the leg was broken in the box or by the drivers.  Other than that the drivers are good and helpful.",
      "Driver didn\u2019t show and helper did. Helper used his truck but I had to help. Don\u2019t recommend this company because no one to talk to but did give 11% discount after 3 emails.",
      "In less than two hours, I was able to select and purchase my large item from Costco, contact GoShare to arrange pick-up and delivery, receive a confirmation call from the delivery pro, and next thing I knew, they were already at my house delivering my item.  Excellent, personalized service from Pauline at GoShare, and friendly, professional service from Vincent and his delivery team member.  Thank you, GoShare!",
      "Edwardo was exceptional. Nothing he couldn\u2019t do or solve. And his communication skills are excellent.",
      "This is the second time I have used this service and both times I have been IMPRESSES at how efficient and professional the contractors have provided service! \n\nBoth times I was able to get the time slot I needed without hassle and the work was done beyond my expectations. The drivers contacted me before pickup, enroute to me, and were professional and fast once they arrived with the cargo. The prices are fantastic for the convenience as well!",
      "I needed a piece of furniture delivered that I purchased on a marketplace. This app was easy to use, gave me a quote immediately, and I was able to schedule for the next day. Alexandr and Jose were on time and made the process easy. 5 stars for this entire experience. Will definitely recommend.",
      "I posted a job on a Sunday hoping to get a driver and a helper on a Tuesday.  The helper committed but I couldn\u2019t find a driver, so I canceled the job Monday evening.  The job disappeared from my list.\n\nTuesday morning I got a notification that the helper had arrived.  I called him to apologize, saying I had no idea what happened.\n\nI contacted customer service and Beatriz insisted I did not cancel the job.  She later said I had to cancel the driver and helper separately (which isn\u2019t possible in the app - you cancel the _project_).  I asked her how to do that and she went \u201cyour job is already canceled.\u201d\n\nNot a good first (and last) experience for me and I won\u2019t be using this app again.  I hired a mover easily through Yelp.",
      "He was great but the second man was a no show so I want a credit\n\nYour company is hard to deal with.  You can\u2019t get in touch with support.\nI had to ask a neighbor to help Eric deliver my glass table with drawers",
      "This was my first experience w GoShare and I loved it. I don\u2019t have a truck and made a lady minute purchase of a large chair.  I was able to get confirmation of a pickup within 10 minutes of setting up my account.  The delivery was quick and the guys were great. Very professional and knew what they were doing. I have a narrow entrance and staircase. Very satisfied and will use GoShare again!!",
      "Service was great. Billing is my issues never w saw a hold mentioned and the way its done almost seems like they are taking more. Besides that good service",
      "Amazing",
      "My first experience was positive!\nGreat communication and customer service!!",
      "I typed Uber for home delivery and GoShare popped up in the search results. When a Costco rep gave me their card, I knew all was good. The app made things seamless and transparent.",
      "Thank you",
      "The company responded to my request a short while after it was submitted. Two gentlemen contacted me from the store when they picked up my entertainment unit, brought it in the rain into my house quickly, carefully, and made sure to dry the top. They were incredibly careful and very respectful of my home. They took shoes off at the front door without me having to ask and carefully brought the unit into my basement. They made sure everything was set up correctly and other furniture moved away from the area and were a pleasure to deal with. They insisted that it had to be right before leaving. I was completely overwhelmed by their assistance having dealt with another company a month ago that was horrible.  I was overwhelmed by their professionalism , their consideration to make sure everything was to my satisfaction, and when people might give a  rating of \u201cgood\u201d I think these two gentlemen were \u201coutstanding\u201d!\n I would never hesitate to have this delivery service again if I make another purchase at Home Goods.",
      "I was referred to the GoShare app by the asst manager at our local HomeSense store to arrange delivery of two large living room chairs. The app is simple to use and we confirmed a next day delivery within minutes of setting up the app. My only complaint is the pricing - which was on the high side for the delivery of only two chairs in my opinion. However, timing was more important than money in this instance so I can\u2019t complain too much. If I wasn\u2019t under time pressure, it would have been less than half the price to simply rent a Home Depot truck for a couple of hours and do the delivery myself with a friend. I guess the old adage of \u201cYou pay for convenience\u201d is certainly true for GoShare.",
      "I was that guy in the TV commercial who bought a piece of furniture without measuring my car first and found myself in the parking lot, standing in the rain with a box sticking halfway out of my hatchback. AppStore to the rescue!\nI had an account set up and a delivery scheduled in about 20 minutes. Even got a phone call from customer service to make sure I had everything I needed. \nThank goodness these kinds of services exist!  Gig economy for the win!",
      "I downloaded the app to get a TV moved. I was then told it may take longer than expected about over an hour. That was fine since it was Saturday and later at night. I was then told I need to send a picture of my ID to prove it was my credit card on file. After I was told to do that I was uncomfortable with doing so, so I canceled my order. I was told I was going to charged a cancellation fee even though it had been pending for 30 min and they told me it would be much later until someone could except it. So I got charged for nothing, and then I was told I was also being charged a booking fee which was $100?!?! They\u2019re comfortable with charging me fees but not paying for their service without a copy of my ID. Stay away from this service at all cost.",

      "Easy to navigate the app and the employees are extremely friendly and efficient. 100 % happy with my delivery.",
      "Moved some furniture from NJ to Manhattan. Both the driver and helper (separate contractor) showed up on time and communicated well. As you know parking a truck on tight city streets is not easy but they made it seemless and easy. \n\nThank you GoShare!",

      "easy & reliable service. I am happy to goshare.",
      "I used GoShare to assist me in moving a large, new sectional sofa from Manhattan to Brooklyn!  Scheduled and got next day service for an affordable price- awesome!  The helper arrived on-time and even came with moving supplies in case, and driver was 30 minutes late; but communicated throughout. Both workers were easy to reach by phone multiple times. The driver came ready with his cargo truck; and loaded/unloaded/handled my couches carefully- very professional with mover blankets and wrapping- I was impressed! Customer service was easy to contact through the app- I had the same representative for two days so she was able to assist me and answer all of my questions!  The whole service and all the moving parts of many people involved was smooth! I am so happy, thank you!",

The service was fine.  \n\nPost Op - After a few days and several correspondences later, the app owner did take my credit card information off for me. I still wish the app offered the customer the option to choose whether or not the customer wants the app to store their credit card when the customer is inputting that information - just like many other retail apps.",
      "This is the second time that I have used GoShare. In both occasions I wanted someone to pick up an order within 30 minutes.  Super easy transaction and very reasonably priced",
      "Waited 45 min last night but couldn\u2019t get a driver. Then,  a driver accepted pickup for 10am this morning. Driver never showed up. Waited 45 minutes at the store and left voicemails for the driver before leaving. Total waste of time. Still didn\u2019t get connected to a driver hours later so I just cancelled. Wish I used another app last night and got my delivery sooner without wasting so much time.",

Was counting on using them to unload and reload my truck.",

      "I will definitely be keeping this app. My delivery experience was great! Brian and his helper were so helpful and experienced, I couldn\u2019t be happier! \nI\u2019ve already shared with family and friends.\nI felt confident using the GoShare service as they checked all the boxes by providing insurance and background checks as well as many delivery options.\nMany thanks, Liz",

I don\u2019t like hidden fee\u2019s or adding fee\u2019s after I agree to an amount. I choose 1 truck. 1 mover. I was within the time and travel distance allowed.  I feel taken advantage of. My driver was PERFECT, courteous and polite. I will rate him 10 STARS!",
      "SHERWIN D, the delivery professional for GoShare was OUTSTANDING.  His communication was great.  His attention to detail in moving and loading the 2 pieces of furniture was great and he took extra precautions that furniture was secure for a safe delivery with no damage.  SHERWIN D was very conscientious with all aspects of my delivery project.  I would highly recommend and use again.",

      "Although they weren\u2019t available for my first requested date it was fine because i was flexible. The guys arrived when scheduled and picked up my merchandise at HomeGoods then delivered it to me. They couldn\u2019t have been nicer. I could track the process on my phone and got alerts along the way.",
      "This is one of the best apps \nVery reliable, on time. \nThe app is also user friendly \nThank you for the great job.",
      "This app is a great help when buying huge things from Costco. The only down side it\u2019s, that the app wouldn\u2019t recognize the type of furniture I purchased and people weren\u2019t taking the job because they were afraid of it being too big for their trucks... I had to send pictures so people will see it. Also, it would be great to see the receipt on the app.",
      "I requested a driver plus an added helper since furniture piece involved was heavy.  No one was available so I rescheduled for the next day. Helper showed up after pickup was rescheduled.  A few minutes before rescheduled pick-up time, I was contacted by GoShare to tell me no helper was available and asked if I could go across town with 17 minutes notice to help driver. It would take 35 minutes for me to drive to the pick-up location on a good day so I, the customer, was left trying to locate a helper at both the pick-up and drop off point. I\u2019m a 60-year old female, which is why I ordered the helper to begin with. This process was not seamless and a bit chaotic. The driver was awesome and timely, but the process was not good for me.",

      "Driver dropped delivery at the last minute with no warning. The company has good customer service and I was refunded money but left with large package and no way to get it home. Just be aware the delivery drivers are contracted and you could be left in the lurch. Might be better to make other arrangements.",

      "The best service",
      "The app is very easy to use. Was able to find two professionals for a quick move. I was charged far less for this service than I was quoted at other moving companies. For the price of moving 10 medium boxes and a mattress from Brooklyn to Queens, someone quoted me $645. Was so glad to find this app and will use it again for future moves. Highly recommend!",

      "Was unaware of this service until suggested by Costco for pickup.  Some difficulty adding payment info on app but customer service was excellent in resolving and also excellent in following up.  Driver did a great job navigating a somewhat complicated pickup and was very communicative, polite and efficient. Driver and helper arrived early and got job done quickly. The price was very reasonable.  Definitely will use service again. I recommend it very highly.",

      "We scheduled a move for a Peloton exercise bike and 5 Boxes from Manhattan to Long Island. I booked this ~ 2weeks prior to the move. I was notified via the app that my one driver  and one helper were both confirmed. Out of an abundance of caution I reached out to the Driver 5 days prior to the scheduled pick up and found him to be pleasant and well informed. I reviewed the fact that the Peoloton would require two people as it will need to be taken up one flight of stairs and is very heavy. He confirmed that he understood. On the day of pickup I also texted the driver and got a friendly \u201c see you there\u201d.  One hour prior to the scheduled pick up I received a call from Go Share customer support that they \u201ccan\u2019t find a helper\u201d and could the driver manage alone? I reminded them that the order is clearly visible to them and that it is impossible for any one Person to make the move. After many escalations and back and forth they asked to create a new  project and hope that a pickup could be arranged by 4pm that day. I had a larger move scheduled the next day so I had no flexibility. Meanwhile the original driver is texting me from downstairs a bit u certain of what he is supposed to do.  The experience overall was so stressful I would never do it again. This team has a long way to go to ensure that the coordination, communication and support measures in place really work to make it a reliable \u201csmall move\u201d company. Of note the driver and helper who did end up coming were kind and hard working. The issue seems to be more structural and administrative. As of 7:30pm I am still waiting for a call from a manager that I was assured would\nHappen.",
      "Excellent service! the driver very helpful & good person. come in time & delivered my stuff .really recommend this company.",
      "It\u2019s my first experience with you. I liked it but it\u2019s a bit pricey.",

      "This is a much needed service. Super quick delivery and five-star professional staff.",
      "I just discovered this, and it\u2019s wonderful. However, the GPS feature had the wrong pickup address, which I didn\u2019t double check. There should also be a feature like Uber has where you can see where your cargo is. But will definitely use again.",
      "This was amazing experience never even knew this existed would have done this long ago.  Guys were prompt quick and so courteous and professional! Definitely will use GO Share again! Thank you!",
      "Great experience so far",
      "First time using GoShare and didn\u2019t disappoint! Very happy with the service and the two gentlemen that came by to deliver our piece of furniture were professional and careful with the furniture. Will definitely use the service again.  They plastic wrapped our furniture- this is a plus! Apparently, not all helpers do this.  Impressive! Happy customer!",

      "I was at Costco today to buy a sofa but didn\u2019t know how to get it delivered to my parents\u2019 house. Costco informed me about Go Share and I was surprised they were able to come in one hour to pick it up. It\u2019s like using a Uber. I could see the information about the driver and helper once they accepted. I am very happy and will use this service again soon.",
      "I\u2019m greatful that your company was able to provide someone to pick up and take very heavy boxes containing the sofa and loveseat. It was furniture that I had wanted for a long time. I just happened to be in the store on Jan 8th and was surprised to see that the color, size and especially the recliner was an added feature. But I didn\u2019t know what to do when I was told that Costco doesn\u2019t deliver. Your business card was given to me by an employee. \n\nDon returned my call and explained what I needed to do. The following day I was contacted by Baron and was relieved when he arrived. He wasn\u2019t able to bring a helper but the store employees assisted . Baron was absolutely great and I was a very happy customer. I will definitely have no problem referring anyone to GoShare.Com.  \n\nThank you!!!",
      "I\u2019ve used this app over ~2 years, and I think it\u2019s time to move on. There are some decent movers on GoShare \u2014 but, for every good one there\u2019s someone who\u2019s 30-90 minutes late and is physically not equipped to move things.\n+ More and more, my appointments are canceled. \n\nAnd the real kicker? You can\u2019t delete your account. I have yet to find a way to delete my account or credit card from GoShare\u2019s database.",
      "I can\u2019t be more happier about this service \nThey re friendly  and professional workers",
      "Excellent Service",
      "Like uber for cargo vans and trucks, GoShare makes it easy to to move anything from pallets to paintings to couches to TVs. \n\nAt this point I have used GoShare many times. It is a straight forward and stress free experience every time.",
      "Helpful guy who was great with communication over the phone. Thanks!",
      "I would highly recommend this company. It was easy to use and very reliable. The drivers and helpers are extremely courteous and professional. I will definitely use this service again. I certainly will let family and friends know about this excellent company and their great customer service.",
      "The pick up and delivery and the two guy whom came were very nice. \nThe part that was SO difficult, at least for me, was checking the little boxes to prove I guess you\u2019re not a robot. I must done this, no exaggeration, at least 15 times. My salesman was also trying to no avail. Somehow it finally worked. BUT, I had to do this again when I entered my credit card info. Again 15 times. If I wasn\u2019t standing in Costco with my new 75\u201d TV I wouldn\u2019t have finished with the app. Now that I\u2019m in this app is a pretty good app to have for moving big stuff.",
      "I\u2019ve used them twice now and I always recommend Go share to friends that are moving. I\u2019ve heard horror stories of movers not turning up or turning up 2hrs late because there is no accountability for bad service. With GoShare the drivers and movies are reviewed so they arrive on time and do the best job.\n\n I usually found other friends that didn\u2019t use GoShare over paid for a truck that was maybe too big or tried to move themselves and didn\u2019t have the right equipment.",

      "First time experience with them. They were right on the ball.  Customer service very helpful in making things work well and took care of my concerns.  They were right on time. Good estimate for time n travel.   Very happy n would highly recommend both company app n moving team",

      "It\u2019s cheaper than dolly but trust me on this not worth it I have to wait to get my refund free week due to the fact that my driver showed up Tony half hours late and then I was told by a woman named Brandy that there\u2019s a big mystery three hour window look at the fine print this place is horrible",

      "I have been looking for a convenient transportation method for sone bulky furniture. I was quiet nervous to see some of the negative feedback on the review site but at last decided to give it a try. It turned out my first experience was pretty positive. No hiccup, the delivery gentleman Anthony seemed having quite experience moving my heavy sofa and the whole process was smooth. I will use GoShare again.",
      "At the recommendation of Costco or use GoShare. The driver and helper were professional and took care of moving into my home. I recommend this service to anybody.",
      "I love this app!! I am a treasure hunter and am constantly finding amazing finds that don\u2019t fit in my car abs now I can get them home same day with this app! The people that I have worked with were super professional and happy to be doing the job! What a treat!! The app makes great a match  because of the ease of inputting the information of what I need to move with the correct mover, size is truck and how long it will take!! Great just awesome!!!",
      "I needed help the next day with a pick up and drop off and got it. The man was extremely careful with the item, was very prompt on time, and very respectful. I will use them again and hope all are are good as today\u2019s.Price was very. Fair!",
      "Quoted a price to move a refridgerator. Waited for a driver but then noticed the order got caNcelled. I reordered and it got cancelled again. I want to the customer service in the app and They told me I had to buy a bigger truck option  and lift gate which was 300 dollars more. My fridge would have fit in original option. However this service wanted to charge me more. I don\u2019t need a 28ft truck to move a refrigerator. 1/2 a star",
      "I downloaded the app at Costco, where I had just bought a sofa that needed pickup within 24 hrs. I had the job booked before I left the parking lot. Kharim phoned me when he & his helper arrived at Costco to pick up the sofa & again when they pulled up to my house. They were courteous & professional, they got the job done quickly, & even removed the sofa from its packing box to get it in the front door. I am thrilled to know that any future needs can be met so quickly & securely by using GoShare!\nHighly recommended.",
      "LOVE this app!! Qualified professionals and extremely reliable!!",
      "I enjoy finding a good bargain online. But my small SUV can rarely fit large items. This service was right on time. I ordered something large online and within an hour, it was picked up and delivered to my home for an affordable price. I highly recommend.",
      "Very professional, very helpful, courteous and  kept good clear communication about the status of the deliver.",
      "So glad I found out about GoShare. \nI definitely will be using in future. \nThis has worked out better for me  than the delivery from HD and Lowe\u2019s .",
      "This service is truly amazing. We were out of town attending a wedding and the bride needed someone last minute to pick up and deliver an item within the next 2 hours since her wedding was taking place.  I remember hearing about the service and how useful it was. If I would\u2019ve went out and tried to pick up the item myself and rent a truck, I would\u2019ve missed the wedding.I\u2019ll put in a request a few hours before the wedding, and they made it happen!  The bride was in tears trying to figure out how to delivery this item.  We are still amazed at how fast they responded.\n\nI highly recommend this service!",
      "I can\u2019t say enough about how wonderful the delivery service was. They called me early in the day to see if the time was still okay. They had my order, delivered it and were gone in twenty minutes! Great service!",
      "In theory this is a great idea. Especially if you don\u2019t have a SUV.   I\u2019ve attempted to use the app 5 separate times now and yet to have my order accepted by a driver.  \n\nIf the math doesn\u2019t work for the drivers I\u2019d be willing to pay more but there isn\u2019t an option for that.  It\u2019s also hard to plan when orders are just sitting pending without any communication.     There\u2019s also no way to put in a range of times if you\u2019re flexible, which may help orders to be accepted.",
      "My first time using the app and service today. It was quick and easy to download. Driver was prompt to the pickup address. Everything went smooth sailing and quick. I will definitely use go share again. My first time was a great experience. Thanks!",

      "This service came through same day and delivered the item to my door. Delivery professional was kind and efficient. Really appreciate the job well done!",
      "I\u2019m so impressed!\nI found a great deal and the retailer doesn\u2019t deliver so I needed help in a hurry. It was a 60\u201d vanity and I live on the second floor so there\u2019s no way I could get it home without help. \nThe delivery men pulled it off and were so kind, helpful & careful. I was going to take the packaging to the trash but they insisted on doing it for me.  \nThe price was reasonable and I was charged what I was quoted.\nFast, friendly, helpful.\nThanks so much!",
      "It was okay. Got the job done. I\u2019ve used more efficient delivery services but it was okay.",
      "After the move was arranged with the app and driver, somebody from go share texted me saying I would need an additional $35 in equipment. In the item description I made it very clear I would be providing that equipment.  Then they made me send a photo of my ID via unencrypted email. None of this was through the app or indicated by the app as necessary. I provided my ID like they asked and they canceled my move anyway. They lost my business. Driver will be getting paid cash.",

      "Requested two guys with a Truck to help move a piece of furniture. I assumed between the 3 of us we could move it as it was heavy. Well I got one driver with a truck. The driver told me that happens all the time and they want him to get me to help. I already planned on it. Needless to say I found a neighbor to come help as well and was still charged for the second guy they didn\u2019t want to send. These guys are crooks and need to be investigated for fraud.",

      "I am a frustrated customer of GoShare.  On June 6th, I needed a queen bed picked up.  I downloaded the GoShare app, entered my request, and within minutes my project was confirmed and paid for... Great experience so far.... And then the nightmare started.  My GoShare driver was involved in an accident that destroyed my bed... After 30+ email exchanges, a corporate call, 5 chats, I still do not have a bed or a refund.  But the best part is the response \u201cyour claim is being reviewed by upper management\u201d.  My advice...hope that your items are not damaged when you use this service.",

      "I am a very dissatisfied customer!!!!!\n\nI purchased a chest freezer from Costco. The Costco staff informed me about a delivery service (3rd party) called GoShare. I created an account, arranged for a pickup and delivery of my freezer.  I was quoted $54.95 for my delivery.  The CRAZY thing is that I did not authorize GoShare to hold anything from my bank account nor was I previously informed.  I have 2 transactions on my account... one for $100 and the other for $54.95.  Then they have the nerve to have these funds being held until Tuesday!  When a person does not agree to a hold on their bank account, or been advised of a hold on their account being put on their bank account, that can be considered as FRAUD.  \n\nI have made 3 attempts to reach customer service via email, but they haven\u2019t responded to me at all.  I will NEVER use this service again!!!!!\n\nHowever, on a good note, the delivery driver was awesome.",

      "As a business owner, I have used GoShare a couple of times now. Their service has really gotten me out of a jamb both times! The drivers have been prompt and courteous, and the cost is fair and reasonable. It would have cost me more $ to send one of my own employees to deliver the time sensitive materials that I needed delivered, than it did to use the GoShare service. The technology is pretty incredible and easy to use, and you can follow the entire transaction from pickup to delivery. I highly recommend GoShare, and will continue to use their services as the need arises.\nM Pep\nAtlanta, GA",

      "Ordered truck, extra helper and an appliance dolly to transport a French door refrigerator. 2 guys showed up on time and loaded the frige in a covered Ram 1500. It was not tall enough so the frige stayed on the dolly at an angle. I was not at the receiving end to inspect, but was originally told it arrived ok, so I gave them 5 star ratings. Later I learned the side of the frige was scratched in the transport. I noticed that the dolly/hand truck was smaller than a regular appliance size dolly (which I thought I had paid for). Also, I don\u2019t believe it had anything to protect the metal from the appliance, thus the scratching. It was in excellent condition before this trip. I have seen pics of the scratches and they will have to be painted over. Had it not been for this damage I would highly recommend them. They should have used a professionally sized appliance dolly, like the one that delivered my new frige. This frige went to a friend and now I will try to cover up the ugly scratching as best I can. I can only recommend this service for items that are already worn or scratched.",
      "So ArtVan canceled delivery and left me in the lurch, so started googling delivery services and found GoShare. Put in info for an estimate ($10 more than ArtVan charged me- so knew it was in the ballpark) so I submitted request. Almost immediately my job got picked up. I called Corey who was assigned to me just to see if he needed any more info to get my order from distribution center. He asked me to text my invoice, and he was able to get my order no problem. Getting it in my house however, turned out to be quite a challenge! We had to take off doors, try several different angles, but they were pro\u2019s and got it in!! I was very impressed with them and tipped their excellent service. The only surprise was that the job took quite a bit longer than original estimate, but with a good reason. I didn\u2019t realize I had to finish the transaction online afterwards. I thought it got charged automatically. \n\nI would definitely use GoShare again!!!",
      "Everything is simple and easy to use, the workers are kind and friendly and the prices won\u2019t break the bank!",
      "I had a little problem with the first GoShare driver but their customer care team was incredibly helpful. They located another driver immediately. I appreciate their help and understanding. Highly recommend them.! In comparison to other apps, they have more availability for pick ups and prices are fair too.",

      "We used GoShare to move three large items into a 4th floor apt. The app was easy to use and client services chat helped where I needed support. The driver was wonderful. He contacted us to introduce himself and confirm the pick up and delivery addresses. He was right on time, very courteous, and really aimed to please.   This service a a very good value. Thank you!",

Had he not grabbed it though I would have been stuck, the first guy should have to pay a fee of some kind, after all if I cancelled I would have to... otherwise the service was great with the pick up and delivery. I don\u2019t like no guarantee after you book it but otherwise a great easy to use service!",

      "You simply can\u2019t beat the service. It is fast, fair and profoundly better than renting a truck.  We were already home enjoy your new furniture in the time it would have taken just to rent the truck.  \n\nAbsolutely the way to get stuff delivered!",

After waiting over an hour and a half, I received a message that my vehicle choice was unavailable and that it \u201chad\u201d to be a two person job and subsequently the price went from $54.99 to almost $200! What a scam! You\u2019re better off renting a moving truck and asking some friends for help!",
      "Chris was my point of contact for the furniture move , he was more than helpful . We were to meet at Costco for the Loveseat at 1PM, by the time I made the purchase it was only 12noon. I called Chris and he had no problem coming early !!! For my first time using GoShare I was pleased and Very Impressed !! I will use GoShare\u2019s services again and tell all of my associates as well.",

      "I would use this service again. Very happy with delivery",
      "First let me say that, overall I was pleased with the services provided. I had concern that I booked my job and the app said my job would be $133.68. Great. After the two gentlemen delivered my items from Costco, I received a final notification in the app and via email that the job cost was $240.68. Reviewing my account this evening, I was charged $373.76. I sent a message and received no response. I want my $133.08 that I was overcharged and I probably won\u2019t be using this service again because of this dishonesty. I feel like GoShare has stolen from me and I will seek guidance regarding litigation to get my money back. Really sad because the gentleman assigned to me were GREAT\ud83d\ude21",

      "Tried multiple times to book a delivery using the app and the browser and it kept closing. Not reliable when at the store and needing help with on-demand. I actually did try contacting customer service both through live chat and email and did not receive a response. We ended up renting a van and moving the furniture ourselves.",
      "Today was my first time to get GoShare delivery. Bernardo was the consummate professional. He called me yesterday to introduce himself and confirm the details, showed up promptly and was extremely courteous. He had my job picked up and delivered in 30 minutes.

      "Simple job to move two filing cabinets from the garage to the basement.  How hard can it possibly be?  They asked me to cancel and resubmit 3 times, asked me to reschedule for a week later, couldn\u2019t find anyone to do it and then asked me to request a truck (for more money) when nothing had to be transported via truck.\n\nMy first experience (similar move from the garage to the basement) was quite good.  This one completely erased that good taste.",

The driving brought it to my home all scratched up and just dropped it off and was so non chalant about it. The thing is, it\u2019s a cement top and he didn\u2019t have anything in between that and the bed of his van and just let it all scrap up. I\u2019m so upset about it. Go Share I have wrote them multiple times. It\u2019s been three weeks and they\u2019ve done nothing. $400 down the drain and I can\u2019t even get a new one because home goods is a place that only has one of everything especially furniture. Do not use this app!",
      "I just bought a home and found a new bathroom vanity that I absolutely loved at Costco. The only problem was it\u2019s a 250lb vanity, already assembled and in a box. Enter GoShare, an app that is so easy to use and made this a breeze. My driver met me at Costco after I had paid for the vanity, and then his helper met us at my house. The two of them got this giant vanity into my house and up the stairs to the 2nd floor bathroom fairly quickly and without damaging any walls. All together, it costed about the same as if I had ordered the vanity on Costco.com with basic curbside delivery from FedEx. Totally worth the money, and would use GoShare again!",
      "I was referred to this service while purchasing furniture at Costco. It seemed to be an easy and convenient thing. I downloaded the app, got a confirmation my project was pending, went to the cashier and payed for my furniture. 20mins later my project was still pending. I spoke with customer service at GoShare, and apparently there wasn\u2019t any interest from any of their drivers wanting to do my project and help. Now I\u2019ve cancelled my goshare. I wouldn\u2019t suggest any other Costco members use this service.",

I had shared the pictures too. \n\nWhile the order said there will be 2 people coming, only one person (driver) showed up. He did not have any information of what he was supposed to carry and how heavy that would be. \n\nHe brought it home but could not carry the futon upstairs so left it downstairs saying he will come back. Later when I called, he said he can\u2019t come back and do it for free. So call GoShare to complain. \n\nI had a chat session with help desk. The chat person said place a new order with 2 people and we will give you $10 off and ended the session. \n\nMy credit card is charged without taking any confirmation from me to see if job was done properly.",
      "I was a little skeptical since it was my first time trying this.  The price was worth it; less than ordering online and paying delivery.  And, I got this all within 1 hour from the time I purchased.  Note:  I also requested additional help which worked like a charm.  I\u2019m never renting a truck myself for delivery again!

There is no one in my house that is able to carry the dressers upstairs, which is why I paid for the service. Unfortunately, they were unable to help me get it resolved.

I tried to explain that there was a different route which would be a much shorter drive regarding the flood warning. But he wouldn\u2019t even let me speak and gave me an attitude. We hung up the call, I sent him a text and advised that I could cancel the trip and schedule a different driver. He then calls me to start arguing with me and told me to do whatever I wanted and playing the blame game with me regarding the wrong address. I already accepted fault and apologized. Overall, very unprofessional. I messaged the people of customer service and they basically told me the driver is not obligated to drive if I sent the wrong address. The point was how I was treated by the driver, even after apologizing. Terrible.",
      "Know that drivers are not trained movers. You have to be very specific in your instructions, even repeat them.

The app itself doesn't work in all the ways it thinks it should: there's space for adding info about the delivery, but the text I put in didn't show up in the order.

      "Worst platform ever for furniture delivery. The drivers do not do what you pay them to do on the App. They are unprofessional and if you are using them as a 3rd party delivery service then don\u2019t trust the drivers that work for them. They always are upset with GoShare and complain that they are not getting enough compensation. Also when things go bad there are no customer service phones or actual people to help resolve problems. Initially when the platform was new they did have people who could assist you and now they leave you high and dry.",
      "My first time using this service. The delivery went well but not without a hassle. The store where I purchased the furniture initially sent the deliverers out with the incorrect furniture. The deliverers retuned the furniture back to the store to which I made the purchase and brought back the correct furniture. Due to the extra time regarding the store\u2019s error I am being charged additional because it took more time for the delivery to be made. The store does not compensate me for that time nor GoShare. \n\nThe deliverers were professional and followed my directions. I would utilize the service from GoShare. Because it was a easy process. Customer service was available and responded quickly. Inspite of the above hassle I still would give a 5 star rating.",
      "In my opinion go share is a scam. They\u2019ve taken several months to push me through the onboarding process. They charge you $50+ for a background check. For a simple email communication it took over two weeks to get a response from anybody in this organization. It is my belief they\u2019re using the application process to phish for information and scam you out of $50+ in background check fees. Don\u2019t waste your time or be lured by these con artists.",

Your only option is to go back to the previous screen where you find out that your payment information was not added and that there is no payment information associated with your account. I have tried this several times over and over and it produces the same problem. This app simply refuses to add payment information. So as far as I can tell it is unusable!

I don\u2019t understand how these reviews are high they must pay people to leave reviews",
      "This is the first time I write review for app. Haven\u2019t seen so difficult-to-use app for long time. You can\u2019t reuse project (modify something and resent), have to enter everything again. Project cancelled without apologize and notification, waste me too much time sent project again and again. Block login, block payment without any clear reason. Cannot transport piano but list piano in item selection, let user send project then cancelled.\n\nSo poor that I have to uninstall it. Yes you provide too much ad. But your app and use cases are too bad.",

I decided to give them another shot and I cannot login the account and saw an error message saying to contact customer service. \n\nKaitlyn says \u201cyour account has been blocked since we received a chargeback on your last project. You will not be able book with us unfortunately.\u201d \n\nWho blocks consumers from utilizing a service, this is very unprofessional and \u201cpetty\u201d is you ask me. I told them I\u2019d take my business elsewhere and I did. I\u2019d highly recommend \u201cLugg\u201d which allows you book immediately and/or cancel if needed. GoShare should learn empathy and things are out of your control.",
      "Not happy with Goshare overall.  The app was confusing.  We provided all details about the move and a truck was recommended which was way undersized for the job.  Goshare provided cost estimate and move duration based on what was provided by us but the truck selected was very small.  Matter of fact the company did not have larger trucks to complete our move.  Since the company does not provide large truck, the driver had to make multiple trips to complete the move which took longer and ultimately increased our move cost significantly.  Instead of GoShare taking the responsibility for sending a small truck and absorbing the additional cost, they charged us for the mistake.   We will be challenging their cost.  Since they have no larger trucks, it tells me that the company is doing this intentionally to bump up their profit margins which should be an unethical practice.",
      "I like the idea of this app but getting charged a pending amount twice is really annoying. I don\u2019t know why it shows up twice especially if you have other bills. \n\nIt would be much easier if they just charged you a holding fee of $1 and then the full amount once the delivery fee is complete.\n\nI like the low cost of service but for the reason above I probably won\u2019t book again until fixed.",

I canceled the project due to all this poor service.\nNow I find out I am expected to pay a cancellation fee of $45.00. \nShame on you !",
      "This is more like an uber for items pick up and drop. Easy to set a pick up time. I felt very expensive. Only 5mile drop off i had selected and they charged me $90 for a pick up truck selection. I may no go with the service again. The person who dropped our item was insisting he would not drop it at the front door and some hidden charges for equipment was added which we are unaware off.",

But the issue is that they don\u2019t do this very well, I suspect because the company is weak and cannot control the \u201cindependent contractors\u201d it is trying to connect to customers. My experience has been that I schedule a pick-up/drop-off with them on the app, which goes well and smoothly. Then, I get a barrage of text messages (why not use the app? Isn\u2019t that the point of an App?) telling me about drivers rescheduling, cancelling, wrong size truck sizes arriving, and basically, a lot of your time being wasted and you realise that going to the local U-haul and hiring the couple of day workers there (actually the same guys who do the job anyway!) would have been quicker, less stressful, and easier. So, yes, it is trying to cater to our modern age of \u201cfaceless connections\u201d and technology based basic services, but it miserably fails to do so. I am not sure why Uber works and GoShare doesn\u2019t, but the facts lie before you.",

I hope they work out all the kinks.",
      "Not recommended!!!!!!!!! Ever",
      "The delivery movers were not the movers identified in the app. The delivery movers seemed unfamiliar with unloading the furniture and moving it into the home. The furniture came bundled directly from the store and was wrapped in plastic wrap. The movers brought a headboard and footboard up the stairs that was wrapped together instead of unwrapping it; bringing it up together made the items very heavy and bulky. The same was done for an armoire. Instead of unwrapping it and taking out the drawers to make it lighter they brought it up the stairs in tact with a very heavy dolly. The stairs walls were banged and scratched very heavily. The movers left all of the trash in the front yard. I was expecting professional movers. The movers were just unfamiliar with what they were doing it seemed like. They didn\u2019t have moving apparatuses which make lifting heavy objects easy like straps. They didn\u2019t seem very strong. I was really worried they were going to damage more than just the walls. I was worried they were going to damage the furniture or hurt themselves. I\u2019ve moved a lot in my lifetime as I am a military spouse. I\u2019ve never felt this uneasy about my items being moved. Only one person stayed behind to assemble a bed. I had to help the mover which was very uncomfortable. He did not know how to assemble the bed. I will not use the service again.",
      "They pressured you into getting more than one person knowing very well only one person will come out. Customer service is very rude and always have some same attitude when you ask questions. I will never use their service again",
      "Buyer beware that my experience was job completion is optional, if your furniture is damaged it\u2019s your problem (plausible deniability for them), and competence of movers is optional (a luck of the draw really). If I could rate negative stars I would- one star is way too high. I scheduled a job to be delivered to my 2nd floor. They abandoned the furniture on my first floor. The movers dragged my furniture on the pavement with no protection damaging them. I had to send multiple messages to the company over days to actually get any kind of response re: completing the delivery and the damage. Response was akin to, first we don\u2019t cover damage the movers do, then too bad we don\u2019t agree our guys caused the damage so you\u2019re on your own, and finally up to you to get your stuff upstairs too bad we couldn\u2019t complete the project as agreed and scheduled. So here am I furniture blocking my enterance and damaged. Nice work GoShare- you should be proud. Never again will I use this absolutely awful service. Horriblr customer experience all around.",
      "Yes the driver left without me. I called them they said they weren't supposed to take me. I said I have keys to the place they said they would leave the stuff in front of the new place. I got to the new place they weren't there. They took my stuff back to my old place and left them in the driveway.",

They double charged me and made my account go to overdraft. Never have I experienced this with an online service. I have receipts to prove I was overcharged but still it is unfortunate that this happened. The delivery went smooth but this billing is a nightmare. Don\u2019t use this service they may be convenient but obviously they have hidden fees (They can\u2019t explain them) and no one likes to use a service that is not upfront about cost. They have no customer service line to call, only chatbot so Goodluck getting in touch with a human about any concerns you have.",

GoShare reviewed my competed and waiver request for the extra $100 in time charged and declined to do anything about it. So if hiring incompetent workers is your jam, GoShare may be for you.

Interesting.\n\nAfter logging into my Club Ready, Title Boxing Club, and My Performance IQ accounts and not seeing a cancellation option anywhere, I\u2019m less inclined to believe this is bad design - and more manipulative business practices.\n\nEnjoy the app, and if you don\u2019t - good luck getting out.",

Then it won\u2019t let me watch a video. \n\nWhoever engineered the video playing feature has clearly never used a feature like that. The scrolling feature is so sensitive. The slightest swipe anywhere on the screen tells the app that I am trying to scroll. Over half the time if I go to pause the video, the app thinks I\u2019ve scrolled back and starts over from the beginning. There should also be a feature to skip forward or backward at 15 or 30 second intervals, and scrolling should only be processed on the video time bar at the bottom.\n\nThe search function is really useful.\n\nThis app could really use a lot of improvements.",

I can choose my own schedule and the coaches are awesome!! They are so motivating, very good at explaining what they are doing and encourage you to keep pushing through the workouts. I love the variety of workouts to choose from\u2026bag work, strength training, core, etc. My favorite is boxing and weights. I also love that they are always adding new varieties of workouts that are fun and challenging. I love that I can create playlists so at the beginning of the week I make a weekly folder with the workouts I want to do that week. Then I can always go back and see when I did the workouts. Thank you Title On Demand for making my workouts fun, effective and leaving me excited for the next!!",

I don\u2019t have that issue on any other site or app (YouTube, twitch, Facebook, etc.) it is really frustrating when the app freezes mid-workout. \n\nAlso, I wish the filter for workouts was more efficient. 8 vs 4 rounds and 30 vs 45 minutes makes it hard to sort for similar workouts.",
      "The workouts are great. They offer a good mix of skill, cardio, and strength that are hard to find with other apps.\n\nThe app itself is a mess though. It loses connection easily, won\u2019t load half the time, and misses a lot of features of rival apps like fight camp and the mirror where you can filter workouts, choose your own music, etc. \n\nIf I\u2019m reviewing for workout quality, it\u2019s a 5 as they are engaging and actually very good boxing workouts, but if reviewing as an app, it\u2019s a 2 since it\u2019s pretty busted most of the time. Please invest in it and actually make it a contender with other on demand fitness services!",

I\u2019m not in great shape yet and the encouragement and alternative options he gives really keep me from giving up and laying on the ground. The monthly price at $20 is very reasonable for the selection.",

Fine if you\u2019re a true beginner, but not satisfying if you have any boxing experience. Exception is Bryan\u2019s classes. Wish he had more.",

Kickboxing, strength training, technique vids, and just straight up traditional title club boxing. Since COVID, my old title club remained closed for months (while still charging members full rate) for some seriously low quality zoom recordings and 30 min pre recorded workouts with terrible sound quality. This in comparison has been amazing. I use airplay to stream workouts from my iPad with no trouble at all. I haven\u2019t run into any glitches or bugs. I\u2019m thrilled.

I\u2019ve read the reviews and it seems like they\u2019ve fixed most of the problems the app had. Now, there\u2019s 2 reasons why I give it a 4 star rating. I have Beachbody on Demand and their music in their MANY programs is optional. I like having my own music. The music in these videos is always on though. Also there\u2019s still a few kinks to make better to be able to compete with how organized Beachbody is. Their programs are really organized and have a cheaper on Demand platform. One of their programs is like Title Boxing, but it\u2019s still not Title Boxing.",
      "I went to Title in San Diego for a little bit, but the monthly fees were more than I wanted to pay. $25/month with my own bag at home is more reasonable and let\u2019s me mix it up with other workouts so I don\u2019t get in a rut. The downsides - My app on Fire stick cuts out after 20 minutes every single time and I have to restart it, although luckily the video I\u2019m watching picks back up at the same spot, and I wish there were more videos to choose from, although I notice they add a video about once per week, so that\u2019s a start.",
      "I used to live in Nashville, TN and was a long time member of a Title Boxing Club there. I got all the fundamentals down and was just obsessed with the workout. I moved to a small town and the closest TBC is probably 3 or so hours away. My gym has a punching bag so I tried to mimic the workouts but it was just never the same without a trainer shouting out the combos, etc. I recently downloaded this app and am so happy I did. For anyone who has the fundamentals down but doesn\u2019t live near a TBC, I think this app is great! There are a lot of shadow boxing workouts but I just do the same combos on the heavy bag and it\u2019s great. My only complains are that I wish there were more intermediate and advanced boxing workouts and I wish there were more 45 minute workouts or just 30 minute workouts with only boxing\u2014no warm up or core. I find myself doing 2-3 of the 15 minute boxing workouts because I usually run or do my own warm up before I box and I wish they had more videos available with 8 rounds of boxing that I could just run straight through. I also wish more videos for boxing were updated more often. I feel like I repeat the same few every week. All in all, a pretty good option if you\u2019ve got the fundamentals down but don\u2019t live near a boxing gym.",
      "I love title, but there aren\u2019t enough workouts recorded to make it worth 25 a month.",

      "I was a member at a Title Boxing Gym for a year and half, but have had trouble making the classes work for my schedule, so I was excited to see this On Demand app. However, there isn\u2019t enough programming to be worth the subscription. As of right now, I only see ONE advanced boxing video, and it was only a 30 minute class. There needs to be more videos, including more advanced videos. I do have to say that the workout and trainer were good though. Would have subscribed if there was just more content.",
      "I used to go to Title Boxing Club for about a year and was hoping this would be a good replacement.  It\u2019s good overall, but pretty basic.

Did they even test it with users? It\u2019s awful at the most basic things. It\u2019s hard to log in, it\u2019s hard to find the gym you want to schedule a class with. It\u2019s just harder than it should be. I get it, each of these gyms is a franchise but you are hurting these franchises with this app. They would be WAY better off going with MindBody than this terrible terrible app. I ended up choosing not to workout at the gym I wanted to go to just because it\u2019s so hard to use this thing!

      "My two movers- Brandon and Hector- were amazing! Good communication, arrived early and very professional- wish I found this app sooner.",
      "Move it was so easy and convenient. It helped me out big time. I was in a short time crunch and slammed with work as well I drive a two door car & needed quite the load moved. Within 24 hours of downloading the app and placing my order all of the junk on the side of the house from my move was completely gone and taken care of. I would 100% recommend this to anyone for how reasonable the price was I would\u2019ve thought it would have cost a fortune for something like that. 10/10 will tell all friends & family even my clients at work. I will now always be a move it customer and consider them for anything of this nature of service.",

      "Service was on time flip was friendly and quite strong, he picked up our patio furniture and delivered and helped set it up . I highly would recommend move it instead of calling others\nThe price was much reasonable than even renting a truck to do it myself. I saved over $40 by using the app. Very simple process once you have the app\nIt\u2019s like Uber , it identifies the person will be there and his truck and destination!! \nThank you move it and flip.",
      "Great app and service. With the app you can schedule the day and time of your move, get a quote instantly and get updates of your move. I\u2019ve already started spreading the word about this app to my my friends!",

      "I used Move-It when moving out of my parents house into my new apartment. They were quick, efficient, and the cost was also very reasonable. I recommend Move-It to all my friends and family who are in need of movers. The group of movers were friendly and did not scrape any of my furniture or Knick the walls. Overall amazing service.",
      "My first time using move it and I didn\u2019t have any problems. Everything went better than expected and the employees and everything about the company is top notch. Very professional and full of hard workers. Definitely going to be suggesting it to many of my friends or family!",
      "This app is a hot wet mess. It\u2019s beta at best, and has not even gone through basic QA. I will say it\u2019s functional, but only barely. You can\u2019t make changes nor can the movers once they have accepted a job. So you have to contact support to remove one guy, so it frees up the spot to find another helper. Would benefit from some gui/spatial changes to make it more user friendly and/or less intimidating overall.\n\nVisionary/executive/owner/coach?: Storyboard the entire application with branches of what goes to what storyboard. Then look at all your storyboards and redesign to cut the storyboards in half at least. \n\nThe idea is great, and has potential to grab a return and expanding customer base. You have to bring customer engagement down, simplify the order process. It needs to be as easy as Uber/Lyft. A metric to shoot for is easier than Ubereats, that app is still a convoluted mess in places to accommodate all the different restaurants and what have you. You\u2019re defining the service/service level so you can trim and shape to simplify/make brainless easy.\n\n(AWS backend?)",
      "This is a two part review: \n1. MoveIt is a complicated app\u2026 it would work better as a website, because any kind of contact or response isn\u2019t easy. I contracted for 2 helpers, and 1 canceled at the last minute. The problem is: trying to get to a real person to get anything done didn\u2019t happen. After Dylan, the helper that showed up tried contact you by phone, all we got was a voicemail. That doesn\u2019t help me when I\u2019m in need of a agreed second helper. Almost 3 hours later, you assigned another person, by it was too late. \n2. That being said, the guy that DID show up, Dylan was GREAT! Hard worker, and easy to get along with. I\u2019m almost 68 years old, in decent health, but had I not been, this could have been a catastrophe. Too bad all your helpers aren\u2019t as good as Dylan!",
      "Justin and Braxton were awesome.  So professional and polite.  Got the job done with their muscle in no time at all.  Great teamwork!!\nThank so much Justin for coordinating and getting Braxton to help.  I will highly recommend Move It because of you two.  Also thank you Randy for getting the job done.",
      "These guys came through every single time I needed them last minute and you can even schedule them up to two weeks I use them on a daily basis can\u2019t say enough good things about them!",
      "Had the greatest experience using Move it! I needed to have a very large rug delivered and not only was the price so affordable, but the service was amazing! I highly recommend using move it for any of your moving needs!",
      "Best service and so convenient. Just like Uber for pick up and delivery.",
      "Justin was great as far as communicating with me. He got held up at another job and let me know his ETA. Everything went great and would highly recommend!",
      "I had a spur of the moment purchase that wasn\u2019t going to fit in my car. I happen to get in contact with the owner and he set me up with the app, and it was done. Super fast, nice crew, highly recommend!",
      "Scheduling through the app was so easy, you able to work with your schedule. Braxton and Justin showed up on time, were polite and did an amazing job with my junk removal. Great company and would highly recommend if you live in Henderson/Las Vegas area.",

      "1st time using this app/service to move a dining table and what an awesome and easy experience!! You are able to see the job being done from start to finish within the app. Booking the movers to suit your needs (big or small) was quick, easy and very reasonably priced. Boys were very professional and the move was on time, within the window requested. This service is so convenient! I will definitely use it again in future!!!",
      "Move It has been amazing to work with. I have been using them for a while now and the service is always consistent. The helpers are on time and work hard while on the job. Always a good experience!",
      "I had booked a Junk removal job. Booking through the app was easy. As soon as I uploaded my pictures Justin was available. He gave me a window of 5-5:30PM for pickup.\n\nHe arrived on time and helped move my couch, garden furniture and packing material quickly and professionally.\n\nI did my research. Called several other movers. Many wanted to charge 40-50-% more. The guys at MoveIt were amazing. Best in town!",
      "I contacted them for a rush next day pickup of a mattress and bed frame and was accommodated in a quick professional manner.  The movers were so nice and well groomed.  It was as a great experience and we will be using this company again when we move across town in December.",

      "These guys are very quick and reliable! They are straight to the point and worked with me to the best of their abilities when I asked them to specifically move things a certain way!",
      "Used their service for a quick apartment move. Good communication. Fast service and handled all the furniture nicely. It would not let me edit my move once submitted however so just try to get everything right when creating the move",
      "I have never used this company but I am so pleased to have learned about them! \nThey moved a heavy bedroom set for me, they were prompt and communication was great. It was short notice and I was nervous but they were quick and efficient. Thank you!",

      "I was referred to MOVE IT to have furniture moved to storage, it was great! A couple guys showed up and moved everything for me, all I had to do was show them what needed to be moved. I used them a second time to pick up a grill from the store. They picked it up and delivered to my house without any issues, I highly recommend MOVE IT for any moving needs you may have! Thanks guys!",
      "This service was very convenient and reliable. Have used Move it a few different times and have had a great experience every time!",
      "This app is awesome! Really easy to use!",
      "Move It is amazing! I\u2019ve had a 500 pound machine I needed to move for a few years. I asked my husband weekly to get it done and he wouldn\u2019t.  Between being pregnant 2 times, raising 2 babies and working full time I didn\u2019t have the time. Or muscles. Or a truck. \nMy friend shared their link on Facebook and after waiting 3 years it was moved the next day!!!! \nThey didn\u2019t have my specific needs on their app, but I messaged them through Facebook and they took care of me. \nI wish I had known about them sooner. They would have been helpful the time I bought a chair at HomeGoods without thinking and ended up sitting on the curb with it looking for someone who could help me get it home. \nThey are super fast, efficient and affordable.",
      "Recently moved to Vegas and purchased some very heavy furniture which need to go up a curved flight of stairs!  The guys from Move It handled it like pros!!

      "Outstanding! Pier One was closing down and I had to get the table and outside umbrella before they closed. Friend told me about Move It and their on demand service. Only gave them a 45 minute heads up. 2 helpers showed up on time, friendly, courteous, loaded my items and delivered to my house where I wanted it. Great service will definitely use again.",
      "Needed a mattress and some boxes moved. Excellent customer service, on time, professional, great prices. Highly recommend and will use again.",
      "So far, I've used Move It twice (in the same week). The first time, they moved a large office desk, executive chair and fridge from an office park to my house. Today, they moved a grandfather clock I bought on Nextdoor from the seller's house to mine. They have professional employees who know how to wrap and transport items for local moves. They're dependable, efficient, and their prices are reasonable. They're still working out a few bugs in the app, but it's still easy to book your move. Try them. You'll be impressed.",

Don\u2019t expect to rely on this service if you are looking for a reliable way to commute in the city. Many times even calling over an hour in advance results in me still arriving late to my destination for several reasons including, poor ETA time, rides with no updates which results in you having to cancel AND occasionally pay to do so. In my particular city there is a great cultural and language barrier which prevents the driver from even being friendly. I\u2019ve personally watched my ride arrive after an hour only to speed off in front of me to do random new pickup requests. Yes, the app lets you monitor all of this including your drivers location. Occasionally Drivers will even mark you as picked up when you are not, they will check off they have arrived at the location when they haven\u2019t. I\u2019ve gotten into cars that are filthy, with no seats, etc. They need a more serious background check to who they are hiring, many of the drivers are unfamiliar with the area, pooor driving skills, driving barefoot, rude, etc.",

      "David is professional and kind! All of the drivers have been outstanding. Love Via when I need it",
      "Not too bad an app but I think they just recently stopped taking Mastercards, neither of mine are working as well as my roommate\u2019s bank card isn\u2019t accepted. How they want to run a \u201cpublic service\u201d but not take cash or certain debit cards is hard to fathom. Yes, do hope this business fails soon but I\u2019m happy for the people it is helping.",
      "Thanks",
      "They never pick you up just right where you\u2019re at, you\u2019re told to walk somewhere else.. and the directions are never clear",

Rides are cancelled after waiting 20+mins and there\u2019s just nothing to be done. Customer service is unable to help out reach their drivers. Stick with Lyft/Uber. You\u2019ll thank me.",
      "Great",
      "Good job",
      "I had been using this service since the beginning and there have been some recent changes that cause unpredictable drop off times and sometimes circles in the same area. I can't use this service when I don't have at least one hour free time, if you're in a rush try another ride share.",
      "I enjoy the cheap ride fair, but they never drop me off where I pinpoint to im always having to walk a certain distance to get where I need to like if I wanted to walk I would\u2019ve done do in the first place. The app makes it so hard to get back in when u log out I write down all my passwords so I never forget them and when I go to redownload the app and log in with the password I kept it says \u201cthe email or password isn\u2019t cutting it\u201d I tried all the passwords I could have possibly used none of then worked, I even tried to log into my sisters acc so I decided to try and do forgot password they sent me a temporary password to use bruh not even the temporary password works like whats the point of having an option to forget password if the temporary password they send doesn\u2019t work either the app is trippin or whoever coded this app has a few bugs to fix",
      "Good and friendly driver. Super sweet.",
      "Since you guys have made changes to your service it has made getting a Via very dangerous to get to your pick up point . I have to cross a very busy street and walk almost mile to my pick up point . Why can\u2019t my pick up be at the end of my street with out crossing a very busy street. You guys need to look at this again and make it safer for pickup spots now .",

      "Not a bad ride, they should really get the navigator in check and the corner to corner is wack. I work for a hospital and it should take me to the hospital instead it will have the app direct me to the middle of a subdivision and I feel unsafe due to the pick up point is in the middle of a two way intersection sometimes. I will have to flag my driver down and most drivers are very understanding of this but some will drive past me and if I am not at the exact pick up spot they will keep driving and not even stop.",

Then, app gave me instructions to scan QR code but then the driver told me there was nothing to scan. Then, I tried to add my friends to my ride but it kept freezing and would not let me add them to the ride and the driver would not let me take them. Too complicated to use.",

      "would not use this app if i didn\u2019t have to. for multiple reasons, i cannot drive and live in a city that has via as a public transportation alternative. the first issue: it\u2019s impossible to get picked up/dropped off at exact locations. you will be expected to cross a busy 6 lane street or even walk down the service road of a highway. this is incredibly inconvenient and dangerous in some cases. there is no reason why you shouldn\u2019t be able to get picked up directly from a grocery store or shopping plaza that has its own address. the second issue: the pickup estimation time. book a ride that\u2019s estimated to take 20 minutes? expect to be waiting well over an hour. is your driver 5 minutes away? well they\u2019re actually already here and you better be ready to run out of your house to catch them before they drive off.",

Right now it\u2019s Friday afternoon and the app refuses to book a ride for me due to high demand. The other day I booked a ride and it tried to make me jaywalk across one of the busiest streets in town to reach my stop. We\u2019ve never had a bus system, and Via is better than nothing, but that isn\u2019t saying a lot.",
      "I jus really want tic thank u whoever designed this concept this service ;of \ud83d\ude01getting us home like right to our front door.Jus wanted u to know U R Deeply Appreciated beyond measure I be having groceries  too lol",

      "First time  was great",
      "It\u2019s been steadily increasing it\u2019s price over the past year but that\u2019s to be expected when a product gets traction. I don\u2019t like how long it takes for the drivers to get to your location but that\u2019s more of a driver problem than a app problem, isn\u2019t it? Great app, through and through.",

The drivers and fellow passengers have all been very friendly.\n\nMy only minus is that I can\u2019t seem to get the function to add a custom tip to work on my phone.  Every time I click it, it resets to $0.00 without letting me save the custom value.  It could just be user error, though",
      "Mid",
      "I love the app but the only problem I have is that sometimes they give me pickup locations that are really far away. I had to walk two streets one me time to my pickup locations and today I lost my ride because I took too long to get there because it was a street away. Besides that, it\u2019s a great service.",
      "Good concept of sharing ride at an affordable price!",
      "I\u2019ve had some really good drivers, friendly too. Please hire more drivers. My son had his rides cancelled 5 times on one day.",
      "I\u2019ve been taking Via since it started and very grateful that Jersey City brought this service to our City. However, there are times the wait times are extremely slow and numerous cancellations. The idea is to really get more drivers and vans so that everyone can benefit from using Via.",
      "The app is convenient & helpful in a pinch but I wish the gps worked better. It makes it hard for both the driver & rider to find actual pickup spot. Also wish the call feature actually worked. Anytime there\u2019s a problem and you try to call the driver it won\u2019t go through. So annoying.",
      "The app says that it needs 10-30 minutes but actually its double or triple that , if u wanna use this transportation order before a good time",
      "This platform is halfway between Uber and your local bus route. You meet your driver on a major intersection like you would a bus but you order it like an Uber. Great concept and implementation.",
      "Best drive I have ever had !!!!!",
      "Via Cupertino. The app is easy to navigate, I found out that it is important to continually check the app after you book the ride. I missed my first ride because the driver arrived 10 minutes early. I rebooked the ride and hung out on the corner for 15 minutes so that I wouldn\u2019t miss it again. I\u2019m meeting a friend for an early dinner 4 pm and turns out Via only runs till 5 on Saturday so I should have driven myself. \ud83e\udee4",
      "Get my destination safely.",
      "The app can be a little slow at times, but still worth the savings not to use the other Rideshare services\ud83d\ude0a",
      "I love the concept of the service. It\u2019s a great idea if it works, but in this case I\u2019m giving it 1 star. Via needs a higher standard for hiring drivers. Some of them are great but far too many are downright scary to drive with. It\u2019s a crap shoot as to whether my 12 minute ride will be a roller coaster or a chauffeured limo where I\u2019m not holding on and hoping we don\u2019t hit another car. Also, the wait times are awful. They say you\u2019ll be picked up within 15 minutes on average, but it\u2019s more like 40 minutes and that\u2019s if you don\u2019t get bumped to another vehicle which delays your trip or you get a text saying your driver is delayed and it tells you to cancel your ride if like. As I said, the concept is great but the transit needs to go in house or hire another company who can do it better and with integrity.",

Many drivers are quick to arrive too even when they are miles away! Love it!",

There have been at least four times that I clearly remember where I ordered a ride and then the driver starts going the other way. \n\nToday I used Via. There was a 20 minute wait. It took 30 minutes. When the driver picked me and another passenger up, the navigation had us going in circles. We were able to figure it out on our own. We added another passenger in the small SUV. With the SUV already full, the driver got another request. On my ride alone, she had to be on the phone with VIA support twice. \n\nI don\u2019t think these are an anomaly but more systematic issues. \n\nI do sometimes get drivers who hand hold their phones while navigating. All Via drivers should have phone mount devices.",

EASY. ive been picked up here a billion times. but after standing and waiting for 20 minutes, the via is near my school im happy but then they continue to go the wrong way TWICE. they need people who can actually use their gps and maps because i swear its not that hard. thought this was gonna be a cheap and convincing way to get from point a to point b but this app is so inaccurate that it hurts. they never drop me off exactly where i need them to. they've dropped me off in front of random peoples houses down the street from my house on multiple occasions. i rather spend an extra $5 for a uber if it means i get a better experience through a rideshare and thats that.",

Similar to Uber ride share\n\nBest,\nDavid",
      "Nice alternative!",
      "Expand the hours of operation. Sometimes drivers stop four, five blocks away from the usual pickup. You can\u2019t cross that distance on foot even if you sprint so imagine with bags too, come on man! \n\nThere are plenty of good drivers and the overall app design needs an overhaul because it doesn\u2019t take the shortest route possible for all the future riders. (as someone who rides often)\n\nGood start but hopefully not the end of improvement!",
      "I\u2019ve been using via for a year now and it\u2019s great the only thing is driver communication.

Also when the driver is early sometimes it\u2019s doesn\u2019t notify me right away and I miss my ride and have to pay for that ride.

      "Mohamed was amazing! He really took care of our family and was so helpful.",
      "Good idea, but missed the mark completely. My Lyft wasn\u2019t working so I decided to try Via and I\u2019m unimpressed. I literally called friends to call rides for me to avoid using this app because it\u2019s just disappointing and makes me late for everything. Calling a ride takes forever as you go through the process of putting in your addresses for it to tell you they\u2019re too busy and make you start all over. Why can\u2019t you just leave the addresses in and let me try again? \n\nFor a shared ride, these are way more expensive, longer waits, and less available than private rides. Living in DC, a super active city, it\u2019s a hassle to have to wait 20-25 min for each ride and then have to walk to meet them. There\u2019s also the safety issue of catching them at night. As a young female living in the city, it\u2019s not cool to have to walk 4 blocks at 2 am after a long night out. \n\nIn Summary, this app needs:\nMore drivers\nCloser meeting/dropoff spots\nDoor dropoff for late night rides\nShorter pickup times \nCheaper shared rides\nMore convenient interface",

      "I live in a medium sized city without public transportation, but they have Via at low rates as a city compromise. I like hearing that drivers are paid a good wage, and the system is just very convenient to have. Getting off night shift sometimes I don\u2019t trust myself driving. So having the service helps me get to my university classes and more safely.",
      "And for the most part the drivers are terrific.",
      "This company is a scam and I DO NOT recommend. As we all know, you are required to have one card on file at all times with your account. Sounds normal right? No problem at all.\n\nThe issue comes in with Via not allowing you to remove an additional cards over that one default card that is required. So if you\u2019ve used 2 or 3 additional cards, the app will not allow you to remove them. The app claims it cannot remove them due to \u201csignal issues\u201d but yet the app still manages to request rides and updates your location just fine with those same \u201csignal issues.\u201d\n\nPretty crummy that want to hold customers financial information like that. I recommend sticking with Uber and Lyft. Trusted, tried and true. The little guys like Via are not worth it all. Much more trouble than they\u2019re worth. Not to mention the issues with customer data, privacy, etc.",

And I keep on contacting them to get my other rides refunded but they keep saying \u201ctechnical issues\u201d for weeks. Very frustrating customer service and the app itself.",

She accidentally ordered fries of course. We don\u2019t really like Burger King fries because they sometimes resemble fries that you would see in a school lunch. While in line (at the Burger King) we noticed we were behind a vehicle with the branding of the hit popular ride share app \u201cvia\u201d. The van itself looked amazing. Simple yet elegant. The only thing that really ticked us off was they WOULD NOT turn off their back window wiper!!! It very much annoyed us due to the back window already being clean! HOW CLEAN DO YOU NEED THE WINDOW TO BE AM I RIGHT?!?!? Anyway that\u2019s all. I won\u2019t give a van number or identification because I\u2019m not a dirty snitch. Thanks. MUAH \ud83d\udc8b",
      "If you looking to get home as efficient and if possible fast, forget this service. Drivers aren\u2019t efficient with the routes, even if they have navigation infront of them. They still go around routes. If you have expected arrival times\u2026 good luck to that if you actually get drop off as expected. Even if there is an expected time of dropoff, it would mostly likely get extended due to different circumstances, like a new pickup while enroute. And lastly, if your \u201cfortunate\u201d to get a driver who is from out of state (ex: NY plate) and depends on navigation apps, you\u2019ll probably get to your destination even longer. Unfortunately, this scenarios are not hear says but rather my personal experiences multiple time and even consecutive rides. And lastly, if you require assistance through there \u201clive chat\u201d, good luck to you in getting a response right away\u2026 how is this assistance chat titled \u201clive\u201d yet you\u2019re not sure if your going to get a response back even",

Even over the years as the prices increased and service started to deteriorate I still recommended the app to friends and family and continued to be a big fan. But over the past year and a half between the prices and the fraudulent activities of the driver I can\u2019t do this anymore\u203c\ufe0f\u203c\ufe0f I was standing in front of the building watched the driver drive by sit at the light send me an alert that my ride would be leaving soon take the light and put my ride in progress.

I\u2019ve been riding with via for a few years now and literally no issues have been fixed. What I can\u2019t wrap around my head for the complete life of me is why?? The city pours so much into other things and ONE thing that was actually good for the community is garbage juice! The wait times are inaccurate I see drivers just sitting there which most times causes you to be late to your destination. I\u2019ve lost a few items that were never recovered to me. It\u2019s just a whole crap show that doesn\u2019t get better! If you have another choice, spare yourself this tragedy!",

And VIA is taking their sweet time responding. Yeah, don\u2019t use this app if you don\u2019t want to be left and called a \u201cno show.\u201d",

      "My main problem with it is the app. The drivers are great! They try their best to get to you, and they almost always get 5 stars from me. The app, on the other hand is terrible. \n\nLet\u2019s say you want to go to a place that is a 10 minute drive away. It can take as low as 14 minutes to almost an HOUR to get there. It is inconsistent, annoying, and it has made me late countless times. \n\nMy advice, if you want to use this app, call your ride 30 minutes plus how long it takes to drive there from when you need to get there. That seems to be the balance. If you don\u2019t want to ever be late, add 10 minutes to that. \n\nThe customer service? From what I\u2019ve seen when I rated this, the top 5 ratings were 4 ones and 1 two. All of them with service issues, and not ONE reply or any feedback. None of them has had updates or edits telling what happened. Some of these ratings happened 1 YEAR AGO.\n\nOverall, good idea, good drivers, horrible customer service, inconsistent and bad app. There are much better options.",
      "Sometimes this app just does t work from bugs, people, etc. other times it works perfectly.",
      "This is the most insanely unreliable ride app I\u2019ve ever tried. The only reason I use it is because it accepts a company commuter card that Uber and Lyft currently do not in the pandemic. I constantly deal with rides being dropped. You find a ride, book it, wait 5 minutes, and then get a message that \u201coops you\u2019re driver can\u2019t make it, so sorry!\u201d  Rinse and repeats 5 times until you\u2019ve been trying to get a car for a half hour and finally give up and walk home.",

      "I love this service it\u2019s cheap and sick. Super useful but man. I\u2019ve had a ride and never had a problem until today. I picked a ride that was a two minute wait, only to wait for an hour. Like Is there a rider priority I\u2019m not seeing it did the driver get lost. On the map she was driving all over the place. At the rate it took her to come get me I could\u2019ve walked home quicker. At the very least she could\u2019ve cancelled my ride so I could have found a different ride, cause u couldn\u2019t afford to cancel it myself.",

Prevent Ride Steals!\n\nEither someone stole my ride, or the driver just inexplicably decided to mark me as picked up even though he hadn't -- but either way, I got a notification literally steps away from rounding the corner where I was scheduled to meet my Via ride, when I got the \"enjoy your ride!\" Notification.  \nI was unable to cancel the trip (no option given in the app, and I looked!) as I stood in the pouring rain, watching my cab (via the app) move north without me, nor could I book another (as the app already thought I was in a ride). \n\nBefore this happened, I loved this app and told everyone about it. It's often cheaper than both Uber(well, pre-drama) and Lyft and pretty comfy and quick. Add the cancel feature in (or a way to request refunds or make other complaints, like Uber has) and I'll up it to at least 4 stars (5 if match Uber's level for the trip options)",

I\u2019ll try and contact and it takes a week and 3 automated hangups and 4 emails to get an answer and even then it\u2019s not a solution.

They are not willing to fire anyone because nobody wants to work with them in the first place so they keep on hiring these bad drivers. Not to mention that a lot of them pick and choose on who they want to pick up and take them out of zone, inconveniencing you when you\u2019re in the car.

It can\u2019t take into account external factors. Suffice it to say, if I\u2019m requesting a via there\u2019s a reason. If the bus was an option I wouldn\u2019t put in repeated requests. Not to mention the complete change for the tricities area was ridiculous and made via much more inconvenient.",

When contacted customer service they only give you back ride credit-no return of my payment.",

      "I haven\u2019t fully read the complete lengthy user agreement but I did notice that in it is a provision that if you are killed, injured or otherwise suffer damages while using the municipally-affiliated Via service you cannot take your complaint to court and have it heard in a trial before a jury; instead by using the app you agree to have your complaint settled by an \u201cindependent\u201d (yeah, right) arbitrator in New York. This is not anything a citizen of Arlington, Texas (nor any other Via-served town) should have his or her civic leaders force them into in order to use the town\u2019s only public transportation service.",

      "The app is confusing. You have to be very diligent about indicating extra passengers or they will not take you where you need to go. When you tell the app your location they make you do tedious walking in the heat to meet the driver. It is too hot right now in Texas to do any tedious walking but I digress. I told the app where I needed to go but the GPS had the driver drop me off across the street from my desired location. It was during the lunch rush hour so I was not going to walk across the busy street. Luckily the driver was able to drop me off where I needed to be. Lastly, on my pickup from my lunch spot the driver didn\u2019t know where I was even though he drove right past me. I called and tried re-directing him but he gave up and cancelled my ride. Leaving me stranded. I had to call a LYFT to take me back to work. I recommend not using this app because it\u2019s confusing and inconvenient.",

      "Via needs to be more careful when hiring drivers or something because most of them are the slowest people. I chose a driver one day it said it\u2019d take 9 minutes when it actually took about 40.

Lets say you request a ride and it says its 18 minutes away, Unless that driver is a about there money (which 8/10 all drivers are not) you will be waiting longer. Drivers will stop and take a break in the middle of your pick up and now your 15 minutes behind because of their inconsiderate behavior. Customer support is average and pointless they tell you stuff you already are aware of\u2026 there so much more I could vent whats wrong with this app, but im currently waiting on an LYFT because ive had 2 via drivers cancel on me and the last one decided to delay my ride. If i could give this app a 0 or negative I would be so happy to, but they are going to get a one star just because it works.

The drivers are late and extremely rude. No kind of courtesy towards riders and completely ignore any request, such as turning on the heater. \n\nI'll go back to driving myself to work.

      "But this time, I really wanted you. Via just lost me as a costumer after several months of use. Yes, it\u2019s cheaper. But it has so many other horrible qualities.\n\nThey pick up other people during your ride and before. So the estimated time they take to pick you up, multiply it by 2 or more. Then it says you\u2019ll make it on time, assume you\u2019ll arrive 15+ minutes late. I use it for work most often. I don\u2019t recommend. I schedule my rides an entire hour earlier than I would like to leave the house and I am more than often still late. I hate it. \n\nNo one wants to set aside hours of their morning for a ride service that unreliable & unpredictable.\n\nToday is my last straw. I\u2019m done. I don\u2019t recommend to anyone.",

I wanted to get the discount for first time users, and the senior citizen discount, but could not over the phone.   There was no way to request these in the app either.",
      "I\u2019ve never written a review before about an app or anything for that matter, and this is literally the worst ride servicing app i\u2019ve ever tried. Firstly I couldn\u2019t get any rides but somehow other people were getting picked up in via cars in front of me at the bus stop, so there couldn\u2019t have been no rides available in the area when I saw plenty. Then I finally got a ride after 15 minutes of repeatedly tapping the retry button, but it seemed that the driver kept getting farther away from where I was and stopped moving for several minutes, then just when the ride was 8 minutes away from me, it got cancelled. So I frustratedly tried to get another one and each time I saw one available somehow the seat got taken, this happened over 7 times, I eventually got on a bus because the app kept saying it couldn\u2019t find any available rides and when it did, someone apparently took it 1.5 seconds after it appeared for me. I would rate this app zero stars if I could. Very disappointed, I was recommended to try this app because it was more affordable than lyft and uber, but I\u2019d rather take those than ever try this again, waste of time (literally). Don\u2019t try via if you have to be somewhere important at a certain time. Thankfully I didn\u2019t try this to get to work.",

      "This ride service is great for areas where transportation is lacking. However, my issue is that I\u2019ve often seen them in areas where public transport is easily and readily available. Additionally, they\u2019re the worst drivers, worst than the jitney drivers in my area. They pull over to pick up and discharge their passengers is such a haphazard manner. This is done typically without any consideration of rules of the road, other drivers even mostly blocking egress for other drivers. Horrible! The others day a driver literally stopped at the intersection to discharge a passenger after making a left turn blocking the ability of other drivers to follow the flow of traffic causing them dangerously block the road!",

I didnt get home till two hours later because i took MTA and my phone died after canceling the first ride and getting a new one (which the second driver also did not answer) so one star for that.",
      "I enjoyed the rides and they were very convenient when I was in the area, but it was a pain when I had to get in the area when my school was right around the corner (but a very tedious walking distance). Some of the drivers were willing to take me there regardless of me not being able to pinpoint anything in Webster Groves on the Via GPS, which is why I gave it 2 stars, but the other drivers took me as far as the Via GPS would go and barely more, even though they were seemingly allowed to go further. Then my 2nd issue, which is even bigger is\u2026\u2026\u2026.I left my wallet in one of the Viacles (didn\u2019t have money in it at all)\u2026\u2026\u2026..but now it\u2019s gone. What\u2019s worse is that I called them for so many days and talked to so many different people just to eventually find out that my wallet wasn\u2019t it their vicinity anymore (they customer service got extremely tedious after a while, so I tell you, PLEASE DO NOT EVER forget to turn around and check the seat before you leave the vehicle, PLEASE, because it is not worth not looking. It was my fault of course, but honestly, they could\u2019ve helped me out and got it back to me).

      "Wanted to book a ride Jersey City to Manhattan (20 min ride) and it is apparently not allowed. Tried booking another one Jersey City to Newark airport and supposedly it\u2019s not allowed that too.",
      "My driver did not speak a lick of English and he took the weirdest route to my destination which took much longer than anticipated. I decided not to use this service and wanted to cancel. The app does not tell you how to cancel the service, so I emailed support. I got a standard \u201cwe\u2019ll get back to you in 24 hours\u201d reply. They never got back to me. Now I\u2019m wondering if they can charge me for rides through the app since I\u2019m unable to delete my info from their system.",
      "plenty of times my day and errands had to be delayed because this app is not reliable at all. always having technical difficulties and saying they will try to fix it soon everytime you\u2019re trying to log in or order a ride. very inconvenient...",
      "I wish I would\u2019ve read the reviews about how they steal from people before I used this \ud83d\ude44 they charged me for a ride I didn\u2019t take, the driver made it seem like he picked me up and never did, then he cancelled. I\u2019ve written VIA multiple times about it and they never got back to me ....it\u2019s ok, I\u2019ve disputed it with my bank \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
      "My two rides today were outrageous priced. \n\nGravesend Brooklyn to William street  NYC.  In my mind it was at least $10.00-$12.00 more than it should have been\n\nAnd\n\n298 Broadway to 420 Lexington Avenue was twice the price it should have been.\n\nI can go on with more regarding how the Brooklyn to Manhattan ride was poorly coordinated (NOT THE DRIVERS FAULT)\n\nFrank Giffone",
      "First driver disappeared, and I was told the next one was a 17 minute wait. The app shows no cancellation option even where the chat bot said it would be. Deleted. Back to Lyft.",
      "It\u2019s convenient, affordable, fast to arrive, drop offs always done within a minute walk from your destination, and never veers off your course to pick up other passengers, it\u2019s on the way. Once you go via, you can\u2019t go back. It\u2019s revolutionary.",
      "How does an app, that offers ride services so terrible?, you steal the user\u2019s money with out even booking a ride, adjust the original price to something else and claim it\u2019s an error in payment method?!?!. Never in my life had this happen to me will not be using this again won\u2019t recommend any to as well.",
      "Had 3 people cancel in a row AFTER driving 5-10 minutes. Probably because they saw a surge in Uber/Lyft (tons of their drivers use other apps simultaneously). They then failed to match me with a replacement driver. Must be because of the bad pay. \n\nLost both my cheaper ride fare and now 20 minutes late to work and in an Uber. \n\nDeleted immediately, don\u2019t bother with this garbage app, stick with Uber and Lyft.",
      "Now cars cancel, cars delayed, and I end up late to work. This \nMorning I called at 11:20 and ended up having to take Lyft and being late.",

It won\u2019t recognize your saved or new payments if you get declined once or haven\u2019t used it in a while\n\n3. You will get charged for the ride and they don\u2019t send you a car\n\n4. The late night cab service either always cancel the ride or takes about a half an hour\n\n5. Ride credit won\u2019t entirely be used unless the money is to the \u201cT\u201d\n\n6. GPS location is never accurate, you have to put the location manually always\n\n7. They always have a discounted price \u201cthe first time\u201d you try to haul a cab and when you switch to another driver the price goes up\n\n8. They give you discounted prices to then charge you the original price\n\n8. THE ONLY pro abut this app is that is cheaper then other apps",

      "PLEASE DON\u2019T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH VIA ALL OF THIER DRIVERS ARE ALWAYS 15+ minutes away & THEY WILL OVERCHARGE YOU FOR NO REASON. I WAS CHARGED FOR A RIDE I NEVER TOOK AND I DONT EVEN SEE IN MY RIDE HISTORY HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE? I HAVE DELETED THIS APP AND WILL TELL MY 6,000 Followers do the same",
      "Work is not guaranteed as posted on their website if u can work for Uber and Lyft far much better company\u2019s I almost committed suicide driving for via if u want a better way to ride Uber and Lyft.",
      "Always cancels rides and constantly books me with drives 30 min away from me. Highly do not recommend. Stick with Uber if you are in a rush. The only perk of this app is the cost of the ride but if you are getting a taxi a doubt you want to wait 30 min for it.",
      "Let\u2019s get the courts involved cause they over charge, steal, and don\u2019t live up to there standards. Me and 30 other individuals are now lawyering up cause we gave this company COUNTLESS TIMES to resolve this...enough with the BS VIA!!!!!!",
      "Via has the most unprofessional drivers ever, these drivers would refuse to pick your calls and claim to have arrived at the pickup location.\nIf they eventually pick your call, they would yell all forms of insults at you.\nAbsolutely unprofessional",

      "I booked a ride. And then via cancel it cause the driver was to far. Then they took my money now I am not able to get my ride",
      "Don\u2019t suggest an app to me that does not work in my state...I made a whole profile and set up my credit card info for the app to tell me I\u2019d never be able to use it..thanks",
      "Every time I order a ride they always say they came and took me and just take my money. I\u2019ll just stick to Uber for now on because this makes no sense and nobody have ever got back with me or gave my money",
      "Due to the covid-19, no longer rideshare. With a discount show on the via app but actually charge you for the full price like Uber and Lyft. Please do not use via. I want my money back. Dishonest company in a time of crisis.",
      "Rides are consistently less than half the cost of Uber and Lyft. Drivers are not begging for tips with needless \u201camenities\u201d. And it\u2019s the undoubtedly more sustainable model. What\u2019s not to love??",
      "Via has been my favorite rideshare app for a long time, for both its unbeatable prices and incredible service. It saddens me to leave this negative review. \n\nI understand that my most recent ride with Via was during NYC rush hour, but my rideshare picked up a total of 5 passengers. This meant all the seats were taken, going against the current CDC guidance that people maintain 6 feet between us to prevent the spread of coronavirus. \n\nShame on Via for putting profits and squeezing as many passengers into a single car as possible, over the health of your passengers, during this critical public health juncture.",
      "The last few times I\u2019ve requested a car the wait time gets longer and longer after you request it. They often cancel your car and book you a new one because the driver is delayed which adds even more time. Not using anymore.",
      "Via\u2019s recent introduction of price fluctuation is absurd. No exaggeration, the app has charged me at times double the amount of a Lyft or uber ride for the exact same location. \n\nThey use passes where you can use x amount rides each month for a fee depending on the package. Each ride allows you to apply an $8 credit to your ride. The issue is they\u2019re over charging by 20-50% more at times than uber or Lyft.\n\nThe rides also take longer to arrive than the other car services. Stay away."

      "In theory, an app is created so that one may automate and create a more seamless experience for the end user. Maybe save some time, possibly create a tool that's useful. This experience may come in the form of ordering a taxi, food for your meal or a rideshare car. \n\nAllegedly that's what lalamove tried to do. But while the App may look shiny and is considerably user friendly, it fails in all other aspects that may suggest a more automated or seamless experience. Some examples- why did I get 8 missed calls from their customer service after using their App? Why was I not able to resolve the issue after the 4 subsequent calls with their team? Why were there multiple drivers calling me? Why didn't the driver correct call me in the first place? Why was I negotiating with the driver til close to midnight on the phone? \n\nWhile training and basic customer service etiquette seemed utterly devoid from my interaction with the lalamove team, it seems the biggest shortfall is in how NOT streamlined the experience is. What should have been a 1 minute App experience turned into a combined 3 hour ordeal. I hope the lalamove team gets it and fixes their approach to their service, as well as reconsider the end users' journey post-click. It Best of luck.",

The best part is not being at the mercy of someone else's schedule! Thanks Easy Van!",

Lugg connected me with two nice and incredibly professional movers who showed up on time and did a great job. They listened to all my instructions and took great care of my TV. Not only did they do it the same day, again on a Sunday, but they charged me substantially less than what the store was going to charge me for delivery 4 days from now. This app is very, very good!",

      "I\u2019ve hired a lot of movers from here over the last couple of years.\n\nThey can do anything from picking things up from FB marketplace to an entire move!\n\nAt least where I live, they can often show up same day our next day and definitely within three or four days. It\u2019s incredibly helpful!\n\nOne thing is, they will even move furniture around in your own home \u2014 you don\u2019t need to be moving it somewhere else. I have found that extra helpful. \n\nThere are a couple of movers. I have not thought we\u2019re so great but most of them have really been good great or excellent and I will continue to use service often.",
      "Support doesn\u2019t read customer notes in booking. Repeatedly indicated need van with ramp or lifting tailgate. 3 out of 5 bookings got it. The other two total waste of everyone\u2019s time. Had to cancel. Not guys fault. It\u2019s booking or support fault",

      "The first time we used Lugg it was great. The movers were on time and everything was great. 2nd time I booked Lugg we were ghosted. I got a message 15 min before our pickup  window that the luggers were finishing their last Lugg and we would get an ETA shortly. We waited and waited and heard nothing.  After our window passed I tried customer service and they told me they \u201choped\u201d to have movers assigned soon. The store we bought from closed so they helped us get our furniture outside. Thankfully a friend came to our rescue and I canceled the Lugg. I\u2019ll be double checking to make sure I didn\u2019t get charged. Won\u2019t be using this service again.",
      "I wasn\u2019t sure, being a first time Lugger, how things would work out. But I had such a positive experience! Deyson and Edward were very friendly, accommodating and SO efficient and hard working. They made moving heavy awkward furniture look so easy. I really appreciated feeling comfortable with how comfortable they made me feel with the move. \nOnly problem I am having, being on the App for the first time is how to tip these great guys.",

      "This was my second time booking lugg and I had horrible experience. The first time everything went so well hence I booked it second time however this time it turned out to be a huge disappointment. Here\u2019s what happened I scheduled lugg for some reason they were not on time they were supposed to deliver it by 6 but they took one extra hour both drivers taking their own time. At first they arrived at pick up location late then what we scheduled took ample of time to load 4 mini wardrobe and took their sweet time to arrive at drop off location then they had this issue to find out the building it was so hard to coordinate with them as there was language barrier instead of hiring two luggers my partner had to help them to move stuff after all this they charged me $229 while I booked for $50 and now there is no one to help me with my concerns all I can do is talk to bot! Is this the way to help customers? The first time I booked lugg I had this giant cal mattress to be picked and drop and it was with one lugger I had no issues everything went so well and this time even after having two luggers this many issues I had to deal with top of that why should I pay unexpected amount for your staff mistake completely not acceptable. I need someone to answer my concerns just chatting with a bot won\u2019t help. Please get back to me if you value your customers and their concerns please \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc",
      "Love this app! I\u2019ve used it about 5 or 6 times & it\u2019s been amazing. Easy to use. Great prices. Movers have always been on time. Really have nothing but good things to say. It\u2019s like Uber for furniture! :)",

      "I used Lugg for the very first time and Kyrie and Charles were very professional and did an amazing job on my transfer of the couch table and chairs. They were there on time.

Excellent and so professional. \nThey took time to help with the rug and couch, getting everything in place and looking great. I gave a cash tip to each\nOf them. Thanks for making this experience totally stress free!",
      "Highly recommend Lugg!\n\nI needed help to have a dresser picked up and delivered from a furniture store recently \nAs I did not have a vehicle nor the muscles to \nGet the dresser home!  Furthermore..I never knew this company existed!\n\nLugg was recommended by the salesman \nwho helped me install the app.  The app was very user friendly.\n\nLugg was contacted and within a short period of time Lugg staff arrived and \nThe dresser was delivered in record time!\n\nThe two men who came were friendly and were very careful not to damage the dresser \nWhen it was brought in to my home!\n\nWould  highly recommend this service !!",
      "Lugg has never failed me once!  I use the app all the time and the movers are always on time efficient and reliable",

      "Enghel & Edwin helped me move a massive piece of furniture- there\u2019s no way I could\u2019ve done it without them. They were so kind and efficient, and the whole process was much easier than I was anticipating. \n\nMoving used to be such a huge challenge - but the 21st century has brought us apps like Lugg to solve that problem! Super helpful. I\u2019ll definitely use Lugg again in the future. So pleased with the whole process. Thank you Enghel & Edwin!!",

I don\u2019t have a truck, can\u2019t do the heavy lifting and getting furniture up to my 2nd floor apartment.\n They take care of everything!  \nYou choose your appointment timeframe on the app. So easy!\nThey wrap and secure your items in the truck. The app keeps you up to date on the pick up and delivery. They call you when they arrive and deliver with a good attitude and a smile. I will continue to use them when I need something transported.",
      "I spent about 2 hrs of my time signing up for some gig work with Lugger. The support team was friendly and helpful during the sign up process. However, once approved to start getting work as a Lugger, I was twice in a row \u201cconfirmed\u201d to work and then given zero work when each \u201cconfirmed\u201d time slot rolled around. I was also given zero heads up that this would be the case from the support team. Please change the booking system for Lugger to only show availability associated with actual work for that times lot that you are displaying as \u201cavailable\u201d. The current booking system seems shady and I won\u2019t reconsider becoming a Lugger again until I hear that they\u2019ve updated the way their booking system works. Thanks!",
      "I have used the app twice and both experiences have been excellent! Wonderful service, easy to use app, and great professionals conducting the deliveries.",
      "Every part of experience was great especially Marco and Angel!",
      "I love Lugg- the most recent experience was not 100-% cuz they misplaced parts so couldn\u2019t reassemble the bed frame without going to the hardware store so I had to end the service. \n\nWould be much better if we could request people we have already used and liked. There are at least 3 other pairs of people that Ive had here before that may have kept track of the parts better and less strangers in the house. Cuz I\u2019ve never had the same movers twice and I\u2019ve used them at least 5 times. I\u2019d have to go back and count.",
      "Best thing since Uber period",
      "This is literally an incredible app I love it!!",
      "I had to haul away things after a store closed at night; not an available option to get help. \n\nI\u2019d prefer to put the actual task time so the luggers know what I\u2019m asking for.",
      "The movers seem to be \u201cindependent contractors\u201d just like Uber drivers. So you never know what quality you\u2019re going to get. The app is very limited and makes it hard to talk to support and resolve issues.\n\nOur movers said on the app that they were on their way but we watched on the interactive map and they didn\u2019t start driving towards us until 1 hour after our booked time. They missed their exit and turned a 40 min drive into a 1 hour drive. We booked 1 to 2pm and they didn\u2019t arrive until after 4pm. Then they tried to force our elevator doors to stay open and broke and required an elevator technician to be called out. We sent them home and we\u2019ve been pleading with customer support to reverse the charges.",
      "We were amazed by the professionalism and efficiency of Antonio and Francisco! It seems like we got excellent service for bargain basement pricing. I would recommend this application to anyone.",
      "Each time I have used Lugg in NYC the staff has been RELIABLE - on time, so nice, agreeable, and helpful! Thank you!",
      "Anytime I need something moved - small or large, these guys are here to save me. I LOVE Lugg!!!",
      "Great service every time",
      "Great company to move with. Competitive rates and great crew!",
      "The drivers were excellent very happy thanks guys  !",
      "Overall excellent service as far as reliability, efficiency and getting the job done. The item we moved ended up being disassembled prior to pick up which was unanticipated, so I asked the Lugg experts if they are able to assemble at the drop off destination. I thanked them profusely for accommodating and tipped significantly on the side as I felt they went above and beyond to accommodate me. They did not inform me that I was being charged by Lugg for the labor time. So a $70 quote ended up being over $440 after the extra tipping. I really wish they disclosed that I was being charged by the app. The changes are logical but it was very clear that I thought they were being helpful and was unaware of the additional charge structure beyond the initial quote. If Lugg could meet me somewhere in the middle by refunding some of the labor fees I would be very grateful and continue to use this app regularly, now that I understand how it works.",
      "This is the 10th time I\u2019ve worked with them!",
      "Great app. Quick, smooth, move of dining room set",
      "They were the best!",
      "I had Alan and his friend from luggs assist on my move from Sacramento to Fairfield. They took twice as long as expected to move everything even though everything was already pre-box and prearranged for them. I felt like they were trying to milk me for time. To make matters worse, they took pillows that didn\u2019t belong to me to help assist the move. It took about three days ago getting in touch with Alan just to get the pillows back. Lastly, I had asked them not to put the tonal on the floor because they could severely damage the Tonal. There was a table for them to put it on. I find that they put it in the second bedroom on the floor and now my Tonal won\u2019t turn on. It\u2019s already been two weeks since then and I\u2019ve been reaching out to customer service and I haven\u2019t gotten a response yet on anything. Worse moving company in terms of choosing competent staff and being able to reach customer support.",
      "Customer service just copies and paste from a book. Instead of caring the situation all they could do is just apologize and not resolve the situation.",
      "After a big purchase at an outlet store, the Lugg team was there in 40 minutes, expertly packed up everything we bought and brought it to our house and placed it where we asked. I thought it was a completely fair price as well. What more can you ask?",
      "Lugg is a great service! I\u2019ve used them for large size purchases for business and personal many times. They work hand and hand with World Market. Just got a daybed delivered in under an hour. All the delivery men have been very courteous and helpful. I highly recommend Lugg.",
      "Had a lugg scheduled for 10-11 AM, never dispatched, never showed up. Rescheduled for 12-1 PM and they still did not show up or dispatch. Absolutely ridiculous and support just gave me a $20 credit and told me to reschedule again after I\u2019ve been waiting around all day at a storage unit and missed work.",
      "Lugg has saved me many many times. The employees are always kind and efficient, and the price compared to old school movers and towing services is an extremely good deal. Also the app is super easy to use, and accurate on time and price. I can\u2019t say enough good things about Lugg.",
      "They are friendly, efficient, know what they are doing, and made a move very easy.",

      "The movers Angel and Mauro arrived on time. They did a great job protecting my all glass case. Everything was wrapped with care. Everything arrived safely. \n\nI would recommend Lugg to anyone who needs a mover.",

      "The guys were great!",

      "Part of my Swiss knife set of apps, it\u2019s the Uber for moving stuff. You can even order one within half an hour to get unused furniture (or whatever) out of the way. Their people are friendly, respectful and reliable. It can get a bit expensive but it makes sense for me so far. The amount of work charged seems a bit high as measured in minutes, so I\u2019ll be watching that next time. But bottom line, it saves me time and makes me effective. It improves quality of life.",
      "Salomon and Darbin helped me with a Sofa that I bought.  They took Exelent care of my sofa. They transported it wrapped in blankets and plastic.  It is not an easy access to get into my living room and there was a great time work between them. I highly recommend Salomon and Darbin.",

      "Scheduled this company to do a refrigerator move for us from my parents house to ours(est. 5 miles apart). Included dimensions, a photo, etc. they upgraded our move to their XL with 2 Lugers. They showed up and said they cannot move the fridge. And it is a 4-person job. I was floored\u2026 first they said it was the weight, then it was the 7 stairs, etc. I asked why this wasn\u2019t explained when I included all the information. They said they didn\u2019t even look at the dimensions, photo etc. until they arrived to pick it up. They also informed us that they didn\u2019t have straps to tie it down. I\u2019m not sure how they thought they were moving anything without straps or looking at the details of the move. I was looking forward to using them with all the great reviews, unfortunately it didn\u2019t work out for us. Just caution if you need help moving appliances I would definitely go with another company",

And there\u2019s no way to contact anyone, so I\u2019m going to delete this and go back to U-Haul that I\u2019ve used in the past and have trusted\n\nIt seems most of the recent reviews are one star with any of these applications.

I couldn\u2019t find anyone willing to do a small move like that with a high hourly minimum, so I\u2019d been putting it off for weeks. When I heard about Lugg,  i went on the app and had my move scheduled for the next day. Easy peasy.  The movers were prompt, efficient, careful, and the whole thing was done and paid for less than 24 hours later. Highly recommend.",

Lugg took over a week to offer me a moving refund and $75 dollars for the machine. Don\u2019t trust that your property is protected by insurance - it isn\u2019t and Lugg won\u2019t do anything to help you.",
      "I used Lugg under the recommendation of my realtor. The movers that came were very nice guys and were there to lugg furniture and that is about it. They did not tell me that if they needed to drive to my storage unit more than one time, which was 1.5 miles away it would be considered another trip and I would need to rebook the van for $117! What a ripoff! \nHad I known, I would have paid better attention to how the van was being packed, as well as not given them all the little things and brought them myself. \nWhen I emailed the company, the reply was a link with \u201chere it is in the terms of service\u201d and no we are not refunding your money, you will pay for the van two times for each round trip 3 mile drive. What bad business! Ok, so maybe I should\u2019ve known, and also maybe it would\u2019ve been good customer service for Lugg to send me something that spelled out the terms of service. I received NOTHING from them. Also, it would have been nice for the movers to give me the heads up, \u201cjust so you know, if we make another trip, you will be charged for the moving van again!\u201d Getting charged $117 again to go 3 miles round trip is nothing to say \u201coh well\u201d over. I tipped the movers generously, over $100. To split. \nLugg sees nothing wrong with these charges. \nBeware! I will not be using them again. They are not keen on customer service at all!",

      "Underlying service is as good as you\u2019d expect from gig-work. However, I scheduled the move more than 2 weeks in advance and my Lugger didn\u2019t know until 20 minutes before the scheduled time. Why not offer drivers the option to take a nearby job ahead of time?? You can still pull people suddenly if you have to, but why can\u2019t a customer try to help someone plan ahead and allow client and Lugger to communicate ahead of time? Would\u2019ve given both client and Lugger better experience.\nOtherwise well-designed app, and the Lugger themselves was quick and friendly. Most likely a case of app & execs trying to CYA.",
      "TLDR: avoid this company for it's pricing model. I was charged $700 for moving a studio apt furniture 7 blocks in Manhattan.\n\nI hired a Lugg XL to move my studio apartment furniture 7 blocks in Manhattan. the movers were not incentivized to work fast, so I worked alongside them as a 3rd member. they were nice guys but I had so many issues with my experience. \n\n1. Dont use Lugg for big moves.Lugg XL is not a moving truck, it's a sprinter van. My movers spent most of the time ($$$) deciding on how to fit my furniture.\n\n2. My furniture got damaged. I guess because I boxed everything up myself, they didn't bother to wrap my furniture with blankets. I ended up getting scratches on my tv stand, couch, and dining chair. \n\n3. Charging begins when their GPS says they are at pickup. But this doesn't take into account parking! My movers ate up 30 minutes just trying to settle parking even though it was indoor garage parking\n\n4. Predatory pricing model. Because of the pay-per-minute, I felt compelled to help out with the move to speed things along. I was the only one with a sense of urgency. God knows how long it would have taken without my hand. Honestly I didn't realize how screwed I got until the movers left and I got slapped with a fat bill. I literally just worked with them for several hours and then got handed a $700 bill and damaged furniture.\n\nThis is my first app store review and hopefully my last. Please avoid moving companies with this pricing model. Just do a flat fee and breathe easy.",

I have booked 3 Luggs - one same-day, after another mover dropped out at the last minute - and every single one has been prompt, friendly, affordable, and extremely professional. I am shocked by how seamless and delightful this experience is. It\u2019s the kind of thing that was unimaginable just a few years ago. Lugg has set a new standard for moving, hauling and furniture delivery. I\u2019m such a fan!",
      "I\u2019ve used Lugg for small moves, furniture pickups etc before and been satisfied. I used it in nyc recently and was appalled. The Lugg guy showed up 4.5 hours after the end of the arrival window. There were supposed to be two people and a van (they charge extra for this) but there was only one mover. He refused to wear a mask and kept taking it off after I provided him a clean wrapped one since he didn\u2019t have it. On top of all this, Lugg has eliminated all customer service except email. They take hours or even days to respond to emails making it useless when you have an issue during a move. I would never use Lugg again after this. Oh btw the rating prompt in the app is broken probably intentionally- if you give your luggers  less than 3 stars it won\u2019t do anything when you press save. Probably why all their crews have 5 stars\u2026 now cue defensive responsive from this sleazy startup in 5..4..3..2\u2026",
      "I have used Lugg for all my moving, and it\u2019s so much better than other platforms - Yelp or TaskRabbit! \n\nAlways worry-free, and every driver and mover is extremely professional and efficient! \n\nHighly recommend!",
      "Scheduled 2 days in advance. Right before the pickup window start I was notified that the Luggers would be an hour late to pickup but would find another nearby crew. The crew was great but the scheduling is ridiculous. I was picking up from a business so it\u2019s fine they were late within business hours. If you\u2019re using them to pick up from a private home/individual person (ie CL or FBM) forget it! What a pain for both parties.  Also ridiculous I could schedule online/mobile without app but must download app to rate the crew so they can get credit. At some point we don\u2019t need an app for that when it\u2019s a one time deal.",
      "On time, very careful, very polite, can\u2019t ask for more than that!",
      "My sister who lives in San Fran, CA used Lugg recently and she recommended the app to me. Today I needed to move some chairs from TJMaxx to my apartment in Cambridge, MA.   Within an hour of booking the pickup the chairs were in my living.",
      "I had a minor issue with Lugg and they went above and beyond to resolve it!  I will definitely use it again and recommend to all of my friends and family.  They stood behind their promise and kept going until the job was done which really meant a lot and made me a loyal customer for life!",
      "Very good timely service and the mover David did a good job making sure to safely transport the piece",
      "Something new to Experiance \n\nPretty good stuffs",
      "Bought a chair at Costco;  they came picked it up delivered it got it into my house. Couldn't ask for a better service.",
      "Today was the first time I heard of this service when I was making a purchase at home goods in Jantzen Beach. The service was fast friendly and without damage. And the best part is it came within a couple hours of me making a purchase!! I would highly recommend this service and especially Jason and Savon. They get it done and on time. Thanks for making Saturday on this Labor Day Weekend! Life is good.",
      "Great Guys!! Professional & Efficient!\nWill Use Lugg Again!!!",
      "First time using Lugg.  Easy to setup and use. Ordered late at night for next morning. App was helpful showing  truck in route and exact time arriving-on time as promised. \nJames and Stanley arrived and moved a super heavy and big piece of furniture. They were respectful, friendly and did the job quickly without any damage.   Would definitely recommend Lugg and both these 2 men-(they have a big truck) you will not be disappointed!   They also have a great personality!",
      "If you are looking to move 1 item or a few, this is the best service. Reasonably priced for a moving service. The people the employ are kind and very helpful.",
      "We were on a short time frame to get PODS repacked from a previous moving company that not only did a horrible job but did not complete the task.    I had heard about Lugg and thought I\u2019d try, and I\u2019m so glad we did.\nDaniel and Kris showed up and saved the day.  \nThey completely emptied the PODS and worked tirelessly to repacked them properly, working late even using car headlights to finish the job.   \nI can\u2019t say enough about the excellent service and professionalism these guys did!\nWe are forever grateful",
      "My whole experience was explicitly beyond compare.  This app is awesome and with no regrets.  I got an instant schedule for pick up and in a matter of few hrs the whole thing was done.",
      "I love it!",
      "These guys were so efficient and fast. Asked if we needed any more help before they left.\nThey were on time and got straight to work. Thank you!! I gave them cash tip, hope that was ok.",
      "Was very please with their service.  Delivered at the right time as agreed.  Will be using Lugg again.",
      "I am a first-time Lugg user and this was so smooth! The team that was sent was professional, efficient, and focused on getting me moved! Can\u2019t recommend them highly enough!!!",
      "Can cost a lot more than you think",
      "Joey and Ken provided excellent service! They were quick to arrive, showed up with a positive attitude and ready to help. They moved in my new furniture safely and efficiently. I will definitely use Lugg again, thanks again Joey and Ken! \n\n-Jessica",
      "I have used Lugg twice and I am very impressed with their service. The first time I used Lugg I was moving and the moving truck that I hired suddenly canceled and Lugg showed up within one hour and moved my entire house! Friendly, polite, efficient. Fantastic service!",
      "Cheap, fast, friendly but dang every time I use Lugg they smack my furniture into the wall and remove some paint. Now that I have nice stuff I think I won\u2019t use the service anymore.",
      "I will definitely use Lugg again\u2014fast, friendly, and careful!",
      "Bought a credenza, ordered a Lugg service which only took less than five minutes to download the app and navigate it. Had pick up within an hour and a half and delivery soon after. Really impressed with the service",
      "Moving is very stressful and costly but Lugg did a great job in giving us the most affordable moving options. This is my first time moving with lots of stuff and first time using Lugg. Was hesitant at first but decided to give it a try. GLAD I DID!! Compared to traditional moving companies, they offer more flexibility in terms of time, cost. There\u2019s no minimum hours, it all depends on how much stuff you have (price per minute). So it\u2019s fair and reasonable. They\u2019re also very on time. They let us know when the movers are on the way through messages and also update every progress through messages. Very transparent and innovative. The Lugg app is very nice, informative and easy to understand. \n\nMy stuff was moved safely and in good condition, no damage. They\u2019re very dedicated when handling our fragile stuff. They deserve a good review and that\u2019s why I did this here. \n\nI love Lugg and want to use and support Lugg. The product like Lugg is transforming the moving industry, making it more customer friendly, affordable and hi-tech.  \n\nPlease keep up the great work! I\u2019m rooting for you!",
      "I just moved into a new place and every other company has dropped the ball with scheduling. Not Lugg. Here within the hour. Super professional. Quick and friendly. Definitely will use again.",
      "Amazing service and pricing. Two guys who came were moving experts and friendly. Highly recommended!",
      "Overall, the movers and the people are amazing. The app is highly inaccurate in terms of arrival time, I received about 10 separate links to track my package. The delivery was delayed but that didn\u2019t bother me. What was more problematic was the communication and the lack of confidence it instilled in me as a consumer. Lugg has potential but it\u2019s tech needs work.",
      "lugger never showed up and support never responded to my email.\nmoney was still taken from my account.",
      "Strongly do not recommend. The app seemed super straightforward but the movers never showed up. I tried emailing the customer support, and have not heard back. No further contact. Strongly do not recommend.",
      "So we got a free table on craigslist and Michael and Dominique showed up promptly when the app said they were going to be showing up they brought a truck and all of the tools needed to move something very heavy. What I mean by elephant is this was no joke it was \nSupposedly the heaviest thing they had ever lifted by far it had to be a 500 pound table and these guys handled it like professionals and champs.  It took a lot of effort and they never complained just got it done. Then when they were done they offered to move a plant from the driveway that was pretty heavy as well because they could see that it was going to go with the table really professional really good workers I\u2019m very impressed.",
      "John and Brent worked professional with good manner. They were very careful when they moved the funiture. There was no damage at all. I like the quality of Lugg. Definitely I will use Lugg when I need in future and recommend Lugg to my friends as well. Thank you. \n\nHui",
      "I requested for 4 luggers so thats two teams. I received a confirmation for two teams but when the day came to move my piano, I received a notification that only 1 team only was on the way. I tried contacting customer service. Lugg\u2019s customer service is via email only. So it takes forever to get a response. The other team tried contacting customer service as well. Lugg finally got in touch and said that it\u2019ll be 1hr wait for team 2. So team 1 is waiting and every minute is charged so charge services adds up. I ended up canceling order. The two gentlemen waited patiently and were great sports. My piano was never moved from my garage to my living room. I do not recommend Lugg for two team services (4 or more people).",
      "I\u2019m very happy with the work of these guys!! They were friendly but very business like. They were thoughtful and showed concern for my belongings.",
      "The best I\u2019ve seen. They moved 2 stoves and a dishwasher to my mom\u2019s house.\nThey arrived timely and very careful with the items. I\u2019m so happy !",
      "They had to climb 28 steps to get to my front door. Then they had to maneuver around tight corners & small doorways of my 1954 house. They were amazing! Friendly and professional. Mark & Mathew were a great team!",
      "Loggers came 20+ minutes late, yet it was counted towards my bill as extra $40+ dollars. Then they take their time moving and wrapping very slowly, much slower than the other moving services I used. I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s because the slower they are, the more labor minutes are counted, and the more they will earn. It\u2019s like if Uber is charged by minutes and driver takes detour to get you there. It\u2019s horrible experience watching them wrapping and inching slowly while I\u2019m in a hurry to finish up moving and continue with my work. I even helped them move because they are so slow and I couldn\u2019t stand it. Then I contacted Lugg support. And there was no response. I WILL NEVER USE LUGG AFTER THIS TIME.\n\nUpdate:\nCustomer support told me they refunded me 10 dollars for courtesy reason and claimed there is not wrong in their calculation that only 31 minutes were counted yet the app clearly shows 40+67 minutes were counted respectively at pickup and destination. After I responded that, customer support never care to respond again. What\u2019s worse, I don\u2019t even see that 10 dollars refunded in my bank. What a customer service I can only say.",
      "Seriously 5 star experience! They showed up when I needed, we\u2019re super friendly, and even complimented my decor. Even though it was an in-house move, I noticed they had a really really nice truck. They were also efficient with their time which is always appreciated. Highly recommend!",
      "Chris and Johnny were just delightful\u2026. They were strong and efficient, and VERY professional! I would hire them in the future without hesitation\u2026. Very friendly guys, and wonderful to work with!",
      "I booked a lite Lugg to grab a few things from Ikea because I was there on my motorcycle and figured it would only take 45 minutes as the app said. I ended up having 2 drivers cancel, was unable to talk to them, couldn\u2019t see where the car was as it didn\u2019t appear on the map and also wasn\u2019t able to reach out to Lugg for customer support. After waiting for 2 hours my movers showed up but they were nice enough to let me know that someone from Ikea was supposed to have all my stuff pulled aside and they weren\u2019t even supposed to be talking to me, so it was a weird feeling to just leave my stuff with someone who wasn\u2019t sure what to do with it. And what looked like it was going to be an organized partnership with the store ended up being and drawn out confusing experience that I wouldn\u2019t recommend to anyone.",
      "Great experience. Luggers were professional, fast and efficient!",
      "They were on time. Very courteous. \nHighly recommended!!!!",
      "Very easy to work with and efficient. Highly recommend!",
      "They were beyond helpful and efficient couldn\u2019t ask for better service delivered in the middle of a rain storm !",
      "I loved my experience; it was simple, fast, and fabulous! I will use this service again!",
      "Lopez and Pablo were on time, moved the furniture in great shape and were quick to load and unload. They were also friendly and polite. I\u2019ll definitely recommend to use Lugg. Thanks!",
      "We\u2019ve used this service a few times now. All the guys are awesome, timely, quick to get the job done, in and out and on their way. We used them today for an in-house move. We needed a desk moved upstairs and one downstairs. Then I asked if they\u2019d bring down our 15 boxes of Christmas decorations, BAM, DONE! I LOVE LUGG.\n\n6/29/21 \nWe used LUGG again today in the hot 114 degree weather. \nOur guys were awesome. Did a great job and much appreciated. \n\n Jennifer & Bill King",
      "Michael and Brandon couldn\u2019t have been more professional or efficient. Extremely polite and a joy to work with.",
      "Great experience with you the Lugg app as well as the actual movers who were friendly careful and worked very well together in moving a bedroom set",
      "I never use the word, awesome, but Lugg is just that.  You can schedule at a moments notice .  Movers are friendly and extremely competent.  Hooray for Lugg!",
      "Awesome app and service. I will definitely use it again. The guys came on time and were friendly. They packed my item with care and diligence they delivered it just as expected. Covered it to protect it from the rain and the moving van.",
      "I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a great experience when everything works, but not having a way to directly get a hold of a human being when things go wrong is infuriating in this day and age. \n\nBuild a chat service, post a phone number, I don\u2019t care how, but just posting an email address and social handles ain\u2019t it.",
      "Don\u2019t hesitate to use this service! Affordable, efficient and friendly service!!",
      "Would be nice if there was an option for the movers to set up as well.",
      "Second time I have used Lugg. Both times I had a great experience with the movers. They have all been nice, efficient and gentle with my furniture. Would definitely recommend them and I will use them again. ......!!!!!!\ud83d\udc4d",
      "This is my first time using this app, I tried dolly at first but I didn\u2019t have anyone scheduled so I canceled it and used Lugg instead. I got a confirmation right away that my helpers would be arriving at the time scheduled, but I didn\u2019t get the details about who they would be until a couple of hours before the arrival time. You\u2019re able to track them just like an Uber and it was surprisingly easy experience. I would definitely use this again.",
      "I had some furniture purchased at Costco but not a big enough vehicle to get it home. I used Lugg to get it done. Reliable, reasonable and courteous. I definitely would use them again.",
      "We\u2019ve used Lugg in the Bay Area 5 times since last year and it\u2019s been great! We\u2019re skeptical of many of theses types of services but Lugg is the real deal. They\u2019ve met as Costco, Home Depot etc. Terrific!!",
      "I would give five stars if there was a way to edit the address once a request is made I had sent many emails to the support office for lugg regarding my mistake and no one wrote me back and no follow up.  I spent much time trying to adjust the address myself and could not.  The driver ended up going to the wrong address and that was when things finally got straightened out.",
      "I had no idea I would buy anything when I went to check out Home Goods Store.  I found the media center I\u2019d been seeking.  Home Goods told me about Lugg and I was home WITH my new media center within an hour.  Great service, helpful and efficient.  I\u2019d use you guys in a shot!",
      "First time using Lugg and they did a great job.. On time, friendly and efficient.  Onan & Ben get 5 Stars!",
      "Great experience!!Guys were fast and efficient, really got the job done. Will definitely use again.",
      "I normally borrow or rent trucks to purchase large items on Craigslist. This service is totally convenient and worth it. You get what you pay for. Expert movers with professional and friendly demeanor. My items were wrapped and appeared to be well secured in the van. Real time updates could be a smidge better for a half star deduction. Solid 4.5 rating. Use LUGG with confidence.",
      "Thank you for offering same day service - these guys were punctual, efficient and kept me in the loop from pick up at the store to arrival.   I had originally scheduled delivery for Sunday but was able to be home Friday afternoon and Lugg managed a same day delivery! Amazing!\n\nI did tip my workers personally, but after service lugg offers an option to tip through the original contract online thru the app.  \n\nCan\u2019t say enough good things about this company.  Will use again.",
      "The service was great, fast and efficient.  A little pricey for 4 min away. But will use again",
      "I\u2019ve tried finding movers on other apps and they often flaked or were unprofessional. Lugg makes it so easy. Professional teams and fair transparent pricing. Only using Lugg from now on!",
      "Great way to get merchandise delivered from stores !",
      "Cool guys, Professional Service! ! !",
      "This is a great app, connecting you with a network of skilled movers from the biggest to the smallest, at very affordable prices and able to show up last minute.  My movers I scheduled did not show up, and using this app, the guys from Lugg arrived within the hour Amd did an awesome job!!!",
      "So helpful! Ordered XL trick and 2 helpers - they seamless moved a large mattress, base and large couch.\n\nWould definitely recommend Lugg!",
      "I\u2019m so glad I booked through Lugg. It\u2019s been the best experience. Fast, efficient and they listened to me and took great care with the pieces that were important to me. I feel like my movers went above & beyond.",
      "I had a heavy Tempur-pedic mattress base that I needed moved from downstairs to upstairs. I posted the job on Lugg and within the hour two guys came and did the job. Zero hassle. Easy. Thanks!",
      "Excellent service, Ruben and Evan took a heavy dinning table bought from IKEA back. They are Very respectful and professional.\nI will use Lugg App next time I need to deliver heavy things from one place to another.",
      "Three heavy pieces moved upstairs and placed into position in less than 10 minutes!  I tipped them in cash and paid for Lugg services through the app. So grateful.",
      "Great movers! They were quick and efficient and had good communication.I would definitely recommend them\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd",
      "I actually wrote a review earlier when requested, but want to be sure everyone knows how fabulous Lugg is and how exceptional our two workers, Ivan and Daniel were!!! They worked so efficiently and carefully moving our furniture from upstairs to downstairs, so that new carpet can be installed. We were absolutely amazed at what a tremendous job they did!!! Lugg will return on Saturday to move the furniture back upstairs. I hope we get Ivan and Daniel again!!! If I could give them 100 gold stars I would!!! Just THE BEST!!!",
      "My movers ran a little late but did an awesome job. I highly recommend Lugg but be flexible on the timeline. It would be better to schedule early in the day because things can take longer than expected. I had no way of getting my sectional from Fred Meyer to home. But thanks to Lugg, I have  brand new sectional in my home. I will use them again.",
      "Ordered a request online. Movers at my house two hours later. They were friendly and careful and professional. Would highly recommend and definitely use them again. Great service!",
      "I am going to tell everyone about this app!  I used to totally stress out about moving big stuff around and finding someone to help. No more! Plus someone showed up within an hour. I was amazed! The help went above and beyond!",
      "I had horrible experience with Lugg and complained to support team. The support team immediately responded and resolved the issue within a week. I have no doubt Lugg have great personality workers however there are many areas to improve and it\u2019s really depend who comes to service on that day. In my opinion, I strongly suggest to have professional movers if you\u2019re planning to relocate 1 bed room size furniture. The professional mover have 17 feet depth truck (vs Lugg\u2019s XL Van-10 feet) and faster to make action which it will be much cheaper labor hours to have the best results for 100%. Please make sure to research local choice what\u2019s convenient for you.",
      "Have you ever purchase something you thought would fit in your car, but can\u2019t? Lugg to the rescue.  \n\nI bought 2 wardrobes from IKEA thinking they would easily fit in my SUV, but the boxes were too long and heavy. \n\nWithin an hour, Lugg had met me at IKEA and delivered the items home for me \u2014 saving my back and saving me the hassle and delay of exchanging and then reordering for delivery.  \n\nAs a single woman, Lugg is your go-to friend to get you out of sticky situations like this. It saves you from having to ask yet another favor from friends with trucks.",
      "Such a cool concept. I was in the process of finishing up moving out of our old house and when I arrived today to get another load of boxes, the power was out, yet we still had our big chest freezer in the garage. It\u2019s pretty hot out already in AZ (95 today) so I was worried about all of our food going bad if we couldn\u2019t get movers here within a few days. Lugg was able to come in 30 minutes! Super quick, friendly and very professional. Will definitely recommend and use in the future! Thank you!",
      "I\u2019ve used LUGG twice in the last month and it\u2019s been great. Super great movers who help me once they get here.",
      "Movers were on time for pick-up and delivery.  Took care to protect furniture and delivered to my door up 3 flights of stairs. Highly recommend.",
      "I have used Lugg in SF and now in Los Angeles.  I have always had a really good experience with them.  I highly recommend them.",
      "I was greatly surprised  by the ease of use, great service and convenience, however, it is absolutely unacceptable the fact that upon scheduling it does not provide clear overview of the potential  charges and ultimately deceives the user.  The company NEEDS to be more straight forward with the fees and potential sum of the service provided as I was blown away by the total tally of my bill being three times the initial estimate and had to spend money I didn\u2019t have on this delivery.",
      "Got a text 10 minutes before arrival window that they were finishing another Lugg and would soon be on the way. Got another text 10 minutes before the end of the arrival window that they would be at least 2 hours and 25 minutes late. The place I needed the item moved from would be closed by then. So, never again.",

      "I\u2019m very happy with the delivery service. I got a good deal on a new full-size LG refrigerator at Costco and they don\u2019t deliver. Costco suggested Lugg and it work out very well. My two movers worked very hard a getting the huge frig up my narrow stairs and into the apartment! Thank you so much!!",
      "The quoted rate is not accurate. The apps needed improvement. Lugger start app when I am not present. We scheduled for 1 pm. He arrived early. I was charged for his early arrival. There should be more transparency about two lugger verse one lugger costs.",
      "Movers were great, the fees and amount of time for one piece of furniture was crazy expensive. Couple have bought new, shipped and paid taxes for the price of 1 armoire to move less than 15 miles.",

      "Friend recommended this service. It was very transparent with what to expect- easy app to follow the steps being first timer ( if new do look online for any promos being offered, I didn\u2019t think of that ahead- but apparently offered by the service) - both the pick up person was informed when they would arrive as was I. Couldn't be happier with booking same day and the pick up & delivery were on time. Both guys were wearing masks (Covid) were super courteous, personable and quick. Would highly recommend (and will) to friends. Thank you for a cool service! 5*\u2019s all around.",
      "Lugg is a great service an app. \nI\u2019ve used the service several times and I\u2019ve had a great experience with all of the movers. They are professional and handle my items with care. I would definitely recommend this service to anyone.",

      "Recommended by my furniture store. I had purchased a TV stand too large for my car and too heavy for me to manage alone.

      "First time using Lugg and I Highly recommend if you have some items to move. I had Pedro and Vincent in an XL moving van. They were extremely professional and smart when it came to maneuvering my new huge 8 foot mirror. It is pricey, but well worth it.",

Showrooms, clients, and retailers are always amazed when they learn about Lugg for the first time. I rave about the service and wish more people knew about it. I\u2019ve used Lugg for years now, in multiple cities, with only A+ experiences all the way around. The \u201cLuggers\u201d are always friendly, hardworking, clever, kind, and courteous. I cannot recommend them highly enough! Thank you \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb",

      "Easier was to get things moved",
      "Love Lugg!! Where have they been all of our lives?  It\u2019s like Uber, but for moving tasks.  We just had two of the most polite and considerate individuals come over and help move furniture and all sorts of things from one room to another.   They also took a load of things to the Salvation Army for donation.  They were eager and ready to do anything we handed their ways. The app was easy to use and tracked their on time arrival.  Thanks for the service, Lugg!",
      "Honestly a big moving company referred me to this app! It's a god send! I had no idea who to get to help move one statue from one office building to the next. Boom! It was Lugg! I loved this service and I will definitely use them again!",

      "We had the best experience with Lugg! We had a rug picked up from a store & they installed it in our house. Unfortunately they did not put our couch back correctly. I got an email from customer service that said they wanted to make that right, so they would send someone to put the couch together correctly at no charge to us!!! Seriously good customer service!!!! We are sold!!! Thank you Lugg!",
      "Quick, friendly, excellent service",
      "Lugg app is good for ppl who need small move but their policy on how they compute is very shady and opaque.\n\nI bet you start your clock for time and your bill would say higher time.\n\nTheir driver comes much before actual expected time and they start billing you\n\nDriver waits more then required time to have clock more money and Lugg would be a mute partner as they also earn commissions. Though not all driver but it Lugg who is to blame for not making transparency \n\nMy case load time was 3 min 46 seconds but I was charged for 15 minutes.\n\nAlways check time else you are being over charge for sure. I noticed this after 4 Lugg charging me more then I expected and then decided to track on 5th one...and I saw they over charged me for 15 minutes...and cold response on refund when asked on clarity\n\nDriver comes early you get charged but if they are late you won\u2019t get compensation. They don\u2019t honor your comment but do say add as drivers read it...but usually that goes to drain and they find new avenue to charge you more on time...so be careful.",

      "It is the Uber of furniture moving!! What a delightful experience.  We purchased a couch and the delivery service the store  recommended let us down. We called the store back and one of the reps then recommended Lugg. We downloaded the app and for the same price our couch was delivered in 2 hours!! No scheduling weeks out in the future. It was done immediately and with great care. Very professional movers. We plan on this being our go to for future furniture purchases.",
      "This service is so brilliant I don\u2019t know what I used to do before I had Lugg. It\u2019s like being able to call a Lyft or an Uber for your stuff.",
      "I need to call these guys out because they were amazing and did a great job getting a big desk system through a narrow doorway without a scratch. Great attitude, friendly and professional. Ask for these guys!! \nMove was quick within the two hours and furniture safe and in good hands!",
      "Efficient!",
      "This is such a great service and it\u2019s super easy to use. It\u2019s totally worth it if you\u2019re moving and the movers are really professional",
      "gaming the app store rating system.\n\nMy lugg experience has been excellent, but with tactics like this you can\u2019t trust the overall average rating.",
      "We purchased a split king size from the store and it was a amazing relief that I did not have to find someone to move the frame for us! They wore masks , were on time,\nCourteous, friendly, and professional! I will recommend and spread the word about Ron and Aaron! Great job guys\u2764\ufe0f",
      "One days notice and I was able to schedule 2 guys and a large van to move some cabinets from west Seattle to Capitol Hill. They were prompt, and careful, and in communication the entire time!

      "These guys were fantastic! Moved my huge Pilates reformer into a small room. Seemed impossible, but they did it. Thank you!",
      "If you need a small apartment moved within a shorter radius, you need Lugg. Helpful and strong movers make it super convenient. Highly recommend Lugg XL.",
      "Fantastic, professional, and efficient!! Would def use again.",
      "Great service! I had to move furniture around inside my house. So much better when you hire someone instead of getting your kids or your husband to do it. I\u2019ve also used Lugg to pick-up furniture at stores.They are very reliable and arrive exactly when they say they will. You also get a text message when they\u2019re coming. Just a totally great service!",
      "LA friend recommended. SF u need to get the word out cos u rock. quick move within one hour w updates u can track. Thanks!",
      "The service was excellent and they were able to accommodate me on a short notice. However, I didn\u2019t know there would be such a high base fare ($70) and charge for distance. That should be mentioned on the website. 14 miles from Vacaville to Suisun for ($27) is very expensive!  Walid & Jose were awesome; in and out in 5 minutes."

      "My luggers came unprepared, actively damaged my furniture as i specifically told them exactly what not to do.\n\nI had to tell them to leave and stop touching my property, they were here 12 minutes and charged me as if they arrived 90 minutes before i requested them, and left 60-90min after they did.\n\nThe Lugg app gave them 5 stars and a positive review I did not write.  I am unable to edit the review and if I click any rating but 5 stars the app disappears.\n\nIT APPEARS to crash but does not, it hides in the background.\n\nI hope everyone who wrote a line of code for this behavior or stamped it for release has engaged in conspiracy to commit interstate wire fraud.\n\nThat\u2019s a criminal felony.\n\nSCARIER?! Apple will probably ban every single one of you from ever touching anything in the app store again.  Or I will sick the DOJ on Apple for criminal negligence.",
      "They will book you for a time and not show up. Very poor and disjointed customer service. I suggest using any other delivery option you can find. This is not reliable.",
      "Movers dropped my refrigerator and damaged both my washer and dryer. Lugg is not taking responsibility to replace the damaged items. Please be wary of this company",
      "I was charged $200 more than the estimate for one large item and they did not complete the job. Use a local mover instead.",
      "The movers did a good job however, they arrived early and I was charged for every minute they were there. I thought I was going to be charged for labor which was what it stated. It was 47 minutes and 15 minutes of labor. I will not be using this service again.",
      "This app makes it so expensive, you are better off getting movers or taskrsbbit. I wanted move my couch I bought on fb marketplace to my new place but they took a long time and (they charge per minute!!) it came out to be way more than expected. Also their van fees are crazy. On top of that the guys were complaining the whole time about the heaviness of the couch\u2026 for the price they charge they didn\u2019t seem very professional",
      "I have used the Lugg app a few times to make moved between apartments. It is a valuable service, however unfortunately it is wrought with fraud. The first time was great, because they came right away, moved the few items, and charged a small amount due to efficiency. The second time, the movers purposefully took the long way to the drop off spot to run up my tab, then they broke my dresser and lied about it. The third time, the movers arrived at the location at 12:11 to start the clock on their \u201clabor minutes\u201d but never called or messaged me. I opened the app and saw them driving away at 12:14. I called them, and they said they had to talk to police about a speeding ticket they received on the way over. Then they finally started work at 1pm, wasting 49 labor minutes at my expense, costing me an extra $112.70. I posted a 4 star review for the movers complaining about this and quickly got an email from Lugg explaining how they calculated their charges and making excuses. They finally issued me a refund of only $34.50, which is criminal activity. They owed me $112.70 and refused to make the adjustment despite having a full GPS tracking history of each of the vehicle\u2019s movements as well as my communications with the Luggers. BEWARE of false charges!",
      "The DSL is of only allowing 1240 address. It won\u2019t allow me 1245 address number. The DSL map located is flawed for San Francisco. Stupid!",
      "We are new to Lugg and we\u2019re so excited to use what seemed to be such a cost effective and simple solution to such a common problem for so many people.  \n\nThe task was simple: pick up a bed from one house A, deliver to bedroom at house B. \n\n1) my husband and I have five children and were in between multiple locations so we carefully selected the only window of time the lugg app had available in order to accommodate the seller and to be available to be there to receive the bed.  We were supposed to get a call when Lugg was on their way to the pick up location (so I could then notify the seller of the item and try to get to the pick up location to inspect the item and handle any instructions.  We only got a call from Lugg driver once he had arrived at pick up location. \n\n2) when Lugg driver arrived at delivery location, he rang doorbell and indicated that the instructions only said to deliver the bed but didn\u2019t say anything about taking the bed to the upstairs bedroom.  Since this is my first time using the app, I had no idea I had to he so specific about a bed delivery since I was paying for two guys, a delivery fee + a labor rate by the minute. Isn\u2019t that supposed to cover the time the luggers are delivering your items to the appropriate place at your address?\n\n3)  They then asked us to pay them cash, \u201coutside of Lugg\u201d for having to carry the bed to a bedroom in the house.  Which, we did, hesitantly, since this whole situation started feeling sketchy but we were caught between a rock and hard place.  If we weren\u2019t willing to give them the cash, what would have happened? Would they have just dumped the bed in our driveway in the rain/etc. and left it there?!?  We aren\u2019t physically capable of carrying the bed from our driveway into the house which is the whole reason we used Lugg in the first place!!! \n\n4) Well, since we then had to go to atm to get them the cash they requested, they sat in the driveway in their truck and then when they had been paid and left the house, I get a notification from the app that the guys left the house and I was now being charged for 43 minutes of time they just sat there in their truck for cash!!! We got screwed and this is not right! I am furious and feel dooped.",
      "This app rips of people by providing wrong information while checkout and then puts out fine print on faq which most of the people\nWouldn\u2019t be reading while placing orders. Please beware and stay away from this app.",
      "I hired Lugg on August 1, 2024, and their movers caused significant damage to my hardwood floors. I provided detailed photos, videos, and a professional repair estimate from a reputable flooring company, totaling $6,880. Despite this, Lugg\u2019s claims department only offered $838.50, claiming the full repairs were \u201cout of scope,\u201d even though the estimate directly addressed the damage they caused. I\u2019ve repeatedly referenced these details in emails, but Lugg has failed to respond adequately or resolve the issue. Their handling of this situation is unacceptable, and I would not recommend their services.",
      "As a blind user and wanting to get assistance for moving, this app is not accessible for screen readers\u2026",
      "It\u2019s very disappointed using this app as the luggers came intentionally took lot of time for loading and unloading. They were taking lot of gaps for resting in between for each box. Even they have taken time for filling their gas when coming back to destination. Finally I landed up in paying for 4 hours which is very unfair. It\u2019s just one bed room apartment with one bed . Washer and dryer, recliner sofa and 8 packed boxes as big ones to load. I don\u2019t recommend this app to anyone.",
      "Lack of transparency!\nDuring the ordering process they never advised that even if booking a service for multiple hours, the movers would only perform one trip. This is a one way move, meaning if everything does not fit and another trip is needed then you must book a new \u201corder\u201d.",
      "Very careful, no damage to house and worked quickly.  Very kind",
      "I made sure to have my ready outside, and lifted it into the van myself. The guys only had to pull over and open the van door. Same at drop off. Why then, was I charged for labor? That\u2019s not an accurate way to measure additional labor and the additional $15 stung.",
      "This app is falsely or purposely designed to make you can't find any customer service and constantly delay and pushing the arrival time. The person who created this app or started this business should get punished to giving people this much a strss. We are waiting in front of the store for someone to help us moving a dining table and with our baby too! Theres no response, no estimate time, no service at all.",
      "One word BAD. I worked with this company for a short period and my honest opinion is they lack professionals from customer service all the way down the totem poll to the labors. Your better off renting a truck and or van to move your own items with the help of a friend or relative if you don\u2019t have ether your still better off doing it your self cause no one on this platform is a professional coming from a true professional who worked on this app as a helper you have to be a dispatcher, customer service rep, laborer, several different other categories of management. you would not get any help from Customer Service and then in the likelihood of damages you would be charged with no proof or debating claims you can drop off an item and a customer can damage it and you will be charged point-blank. No discussion no investigation.. Believe me I\u2019ve tried. I\u2019ve even went a step further and equipped, myself with a body camera to have footage of these moves. Booked by Lugg and let me tell you bad bad bad unprofessional from beginning to end and I have the proof my profile will show you. I have over 100 moves, but one bad review due to Lugg telling individuals that we can do the impossible. Once again, I have proof screenshots of messages videos email sent. to Customer Service and let me tell you they do not care so don\u2019t waste your time working or booking any moves to this company trash",
      "Horrible customer service, horrible movers, horrible experience all around.\nMovers showed up an hour late, took their sweet time, clearly stalling. They spent 113 minutes just to move a fridge one flight of stairs. Neither of them knew what they were doing. It was a total scheme to charge me\n$200. \nYou can not get ahold of any customer support. It\u2019s awful. This is a scam. Stay away.",
      "These people are unprofessional and did not complete my delivery. They refused to give me my money back. Steer clear of these crooks.",
      "Most idiotic product fail, can\u2019t even blame UX. Like any other share economy service, the people doing the work are awesome, the people making the product are dropping the ball on the customers and their gig employees.\n\nFor some unknowable reason the platform will let you search the needed destination or service, and even offer suggestions on destinations and allow you to schedule, whether that location is open or not. And you as the customer are supposed to assume against the reason implied by being allowed to schedule for that place and time, that the destination may not be open and call to confirm before booking (which could also result in you losing the available booking time).\n\nIf the LUGG suggested destination isn\u2019t open, you will have to find an alternate location or have the item returned to you - all of which incur continued per minute labor fee on top of the flat rate and labor fee being charged from the moment they left your pick up address. Preventable of the backend booking system actually spoke to the scheduling system OR a simple destructive action warning prior to booking something that is potentially closed. Absolutely unhinged product thinking.",
      "Ridiculous. \n\nThe lack of a flat fee and having the movers enter their own time is insane. I\u2019ll never use this again.\n\nI have things moved all the time by professional companies that give you an estimate and generally stick to it. I wanted to try this service and I\u2019ll never touch it again. \n\nWhat should have been (when I use normal, professional services) a $350 job was $500. Again - I move things a lot, I make furniture, and know the costs and time involved.",
      "As a worker for Lugg I can honestly say do not trust this app. I have been rudely talked to by \u201csupport\u201d. I have been underpaid/not paid at all for shifts worked.

      "Hi, I contacted your support, they are trying to get away by saying \"there was no mention of TV\" in your items, even though I said I can prove it via images in the storage. They are trying to cheat and not take responsibility of breaking the TV.",
      "Have used them couple times first time they were fine but the second time they overcharged me and damaged the TV and when I talk to them about claiming insurance on that, they denied saying that there was no TV. \n\nThis is ridiculous because I told them I have the pictures and i will show them including the storage, but they choose not to do anything.  I would not trust them anymore.",
      "The movers arrived earlier than the agreed-upon pickup window, and Lugg billed me for the quarter-hour they spent sitting in the van before my move officially began. The total labor time ended up being 86 minutes for two people to move a 6 x 3\u2019 dining table from one elevator building to another elevator building. There are numerous cheaper moving services out there. I\u2019ll be deleting this app.",
      "I hired this company to move my new bed into the house. The mattress was to big and could not be taken upstairs (not their fault). They were supposed to move the base in and set it up. They moved the base into the bedroom, plugged it in and left. No instruction of use, no test of power. He handed me the remote and said, \u201cHey, you take care of this.\u201d Now the base does not work and I cannot get underneath to see if it is connected correctly. I was told when I hired these guys, they would bring base in, set it up and make sure it works. Now I am stuck trying to figure out this on my own.",

      "I was charged triple the price I was originally quoted on the app. I have used LUGG App before without any problems. I will definitely not be using or referring LUGG\u2019s services again! Very disappointed with the pricing fees charged to me by this small 12 pc storage move.",

      "DO NOT USE THIS PLATFORM NO MATTER WHAT YOUR NEED IS!!! THE MOVERS ON THIS APP ARE NOT VETTED OR ACCREDITED MOVERS, THESE GUYS DAMAGED A $7000 SOFA AND THEY ARE DOING NOTHING ABOUT IT!!!!! THESE GUYS ARE CONNIVING CON ARTISTS!!!!!!!!!!!!! When you read the lugg info page and request movers it says they bring straps, Dollies and protective gear. They did no such thing, two Joe schmo looking people showed up, retrieved the sofa and proceeded to literally launch it down my stairs, nearly killing themselves, they damaged my walls, they ripped the sofa, broke the frame. When we arrived to the storage unit the sofa was shoved around corners and literally forced through the door where two of the feet broke off and parts of the frame began splintering from the force at which it was shoved into the unit. I feel scammed, I feel defeated, and I\u2019m utterly reeling over the entire experience. I feel like I just made the largest mistake of my life entrusting my items with this company and I wish I could rewind and take back every second of it.\n\nUpdate: Lugg got back to me with 2 options, the first was to keep the sofa and they would send me $400 to repair it. This sofa has extensive frame damage and the fabric is destroyed\u2014a new slipcover costs nearly 2k and to have an 8-way hand tied sofa repaired also costs THOUSANDS what a joke!!!!!!! The second option was that I could dispose of the sofa and they\u2019d send me 1400\u2013BUT I apparently have to schedule the disposal through Lugg and find a dump site for the sofa. Boston doesn\u2019t have public dump sites, we have to leave the furniture on the street and schedule a bulk pickup. Lugg said that this option isn\u2019t feasible. I then asked Lugg if they can set up a junk removal service to come pick it up and they said no. So it really seems like Lugg doesn\u2019t want to do the right thing and definitely isn\u2019t taking any responsibility in their damaging my belongings. Would give 0 stars to this entire company, I hope it goes bankrupt",
      "The app only has very basic features. If you want to communicate with anyone you can\u2019t do it in the app until your drivers are on the way. Otherwise you have to email customer service for everything. They start charging for delivery once the drivers arrive at the building but not before they\u2019ve parked so when it took my drivers an extra 45 mins to park they charged me for their incompetence. I had to go back and forth with customer service who eventually refunded me for SOME of the parking fiasco. The price of delivery ended up being MUCH more than their original estimate. I am very upset I used this service and do not recommend it to anyone.",
      "They will literally make you drive all around the city for one delivery per day. You pick up a shift to work and they only give you one job during the whole shift. It\u2019s not worth it.

Please people don\u2019t support these evil and greedy company.",

They were super nice and apologized stating that they should not have been dispatched. \n\nSecond set of guys came in and immediately they said they couldn\u2019t lift more than 100 pounds and for me to cancel it. I explained that I had used Lugg before to move the same freezer. Then they told me to to book a second set of guys to help them. Ridiculous! They told me I needed to cancel it and they wouldn\u2019t leave until I cancelled it. \n\nBad service.",
      "Our Luggers failed to pickup our full order from a furniture store, then Lug\u2019s customer service blamed us for not clarifying what they were picking up even after we shared a receipt listing all items with the Luggers. They only offered a partial refund even though I had to make other arrangements to pickup the furniture they left at the store. Overall terrible experience and will not be using Lug again.",
      "The movers never showed up and didn\u2019t even send a message letting me know they wouldn\u2019t be coming. I sent about 5 emails to customer support and all went unanswered. There is no phone number and no way to contact anyone within the app. Terrible experience and would never use again.",

Try to make a claim and went to several email until I was told to that I had to reach out personal to the driver and try and file a claim with there personal insurance. Lugg basically washed their hands of any responsibility. Your better of hiring a professional moving company like I did. It might cost a little more but at least they are professional and take responsibility. You get what you pay for with this company or should I say just a app.",
      "The drivers will stall and take their time to strike up conversations that go on and on and on and as you try to wrap it up telling them family is sleeping and you need to go thru keep talking ! Why ? Because you are being charged as the minutes go by - scammers ! Rush them out the door and don\u2019t talk to them because they keep charging you until they drive off ! First time this happened and I won\u2019t  ever use this service again - disgusting",

I needed extra movers for an extra heavy piece of furniture and I couldn\u2019t schedule them at the same time, there should be a way to request more movers at the same time if their is a weight limit.\n2 The app changed the city on my address even though the map on my side showed the correct location. This sent the movers to the wrong destination city and it took an extra hour to get them to understand and come to my house.\n3. The app stopped functioning in the middle of my move and I had no way to get the contact info of the movers to communicate with them.",

      "Horrible experience,I was supposed to have three pieces of furniture delivered and when the delivery men came they only had one of the pieces. They assured me they made a mistake it would go back to the furniture store to retrieve the other two items promptly. I have been waiting over two weeks contacting both of these knuckleheads daily, they kept assuring me they would bring me the other two pieces. There were supposed to show up today and when I reached out they said they didn\u2019t feel like working today. Waste of money waste of time extremely frustrating do yourself a favor and don\u2019t use the service!!!

There is NO customer service and  I had to write many emails before I got a response from them saying they would give me a partial refund ONLY after I paid the entire amount!!!

If the guys that show up are cool everything works smoothly, but you don\u2019t have a choice who shows up. If a four or heaven forbid three star crew shows up you are better off canceling the whole thing and trying again later. The faq is also useless. They specifically list pianos as things they move, but in my experience that is just plain wrong. I had two crews (4 guys) show up, after stating that I needed to move a piano. They looked at the Yamaha U1, said this is too big& heavy and left. I called a local mover, 2 guys showed and moved it no issue.",

They could not fit a piece of furniture in the van, so they told me i had to hire an XL van instead\u2014i booked Cally and Almir, who told me they needed two extra hands, so i booked Efosa and Greg (in the afternoon)\n\nI would like to file a formal complaint against these movers, and Greg in particular. I had an absolutely horrific experience with them\u2014the highlights include: \n\n- damaged property (a wooden crate and barrel cabinet worth thousands of dollars; damage was to a door that was dropped against concrete steps in front of my building. I know for sure a Greg saw it break but he did not bring it to my attention. I pointed it out and all four movers acknowledged that that damage was caused by them) \n- more damaged property (a new pottery barn Mateo head board that was dropped by my first Luggers of the day and tore the wood straight off the upper corner. This occurred with Matthew and Tejas.) \n- terrible customer service (poor attitudes, lack of motivation, unnecessary commentary and verbal complaining, general laziness, and they were physically unable to do the job) \n- trespassing and unacceptable behavior (Greg was seen at the pick up location walking behind my mothers property. He returned after a minute or two and we assume he was urinating in our back yard)\n- excess charges (we were billed for them to sit around and wait in our front drive way for pick up while the other Lugg crew drove the larger van from over an hour away) \n- stolen property (a wooden $250 book shelf that was loaded onto Greg\u2019s silver pick up truck. The shelf never made it to my apartment and i currently do no know it\u2019s whereabouts. This is absolutely unacceptable and if it is not returned to me, I will have no choice but to file a police report for stolen property.)\n\nI am requesting a full refund for: Matthew and Tejas ($371 before tip, they did not complete the task requested and damaged furniture), Cally and Almir\u2019s time ($365, they did not complete the task requested and damaged furniture), Efosa and Greg\u2019s time ($301, they did not complete the task requested, damaged furniture, trespassed on my property, and stole a bookshelf), and reimbursement for all damaged and destroyed items. \n\nPlease respond to me at your earliest convenience.

They almost dropped my heavy item over handrail to pavement! Dropped item several times on ground and floor, bashed item against railings and doorway, worker (no gloves?) cut himself and bled on item and house. He had no first aid items in truck, luckily I did. Will take multiple sources and repair people to address more than $2K of damage to house and item - parts and labor for wood work, metal work, metal fabricating and plating, laminate repair, installation and painting. They expect me to find, call, get quotes from, hire and manage all of the people and get parts for repairs in a SF labor market and COVID supply chain where barely anyone returns calls. Spent hours getting verbal and texted estimates for $2K+ They offered me a refund of the $81 Lugg fee for the 30 minutes of destruction they caused. After I complained they offered another $300. If they want to cause all if this damage and make me do tons of work to get it fixed and pay for most of it, I'd rather write this review and warn others.",

There is only an email address which does not offer a quick response (I didn\u2019t get the email until the next day). We waited around for hours and the Luggers never arrived. We had to scramble to find other movers for our emergency move. I\u2019ve never been screwed over so hard by a moving \u201ccompany\u201d. This is an absolute scam!",

Now it\u2019s too late to find another mover this late at night, and all the things that I prepared to get moved are now sitting unsecured in a hallway because I can\u2019t get them up to my in myself, which is why I hired a Lugg. So disappointed and stressful, I now have to spend even more time to try to scramble to find a last minute solution late at night.

Worst of all, Lugg does not have a phone number and will pass you between different support reps over email, with several days delay by before giving a response.

      "I called Lugg to pickup a furniture from store to my apartment. The Lugg was supposed to reach me at the store within 30 mins. After 40 minutes, after many calls, I was able to reach the driver, who told me he got wrong address from Lugg and was heading the completely opposite direction. At this point, he was over 20 mins from me and the store was closing in 15 mins. I had to cancel the Lugg call. Very disappointed with my first try with the app, probably won\u2019t use it or recommend anyone to use it ever again.",
      "Oh boy, be warned the blind fees are twice as much as the base rate at minimum. $71. Plus because I have yet to be charged for a disposable fee which I was warned would happen, rate was not disclosed neither the blind fees.  All for a  full size mattress. I reached out to costumer service, to no avail.  I will never use this company again!",
      "The price they show online is nothing like what they end up charging you without telling you. Online it told me $116 plus 1.60 a mile it end up costing $271 to move I refrigerator 20 miles. Will never use them ever again.",
      "I\u2019ve used Lugg movers for so many things and it\u2019s been nothing but great. We moved homes and they did a great job moving things from one house to the other. They helped us unload our Pods. They have also picked up a couple of items we purchased from Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist. Never an issue and always on time.  They are my first choice now for movers.",
      "My item was too heavy for the crew, despite the fact that I already told them what I needed to move (an upright piano). I had to msg customer service to see what to do. First, there is NO PHONE support. Second, waited over 20min for the chat, and I was charged for the time the crew waited for their customer service (same rate as if the crew was moving stuff). Their rate ended up being 2x more expensive than the local mover and their staff were teenagers and extremely unprofessional. They offered a $10 credit next time I need to use their service. No, this is the first time and will be the only time I use their service.",
      "I was charged $350 for two hours of service when the movers spent 20 minutes per elevator ride and talking in my face wasting time. I carried most of the boxes I had to get on my own. This was a disservice. I\u2019m pretty hurt but the way I was taken advantage of. The bed is not out together completely. I didn\u2019t leave a tip. I want my money back.",
      "Damaged my property and wouldn\u2019t do anything about it and still charged me an outrageous amount when they weren\u2019t working half the time",
      "I did the pickup truck because I thought they could do two trips I ended up having to pay a ton to get another pickup and really am upset that I didn\u2019t do the large van you all should mention it\u2019s restricted to one trip not one hour or so",
      "Lugg is false advertising how much you get paid working for them. Plus they make you work over the required hours your supposed to work and still pay you below minimum wage. This app is an app for workers to get scammed don\u2019t fall for lugg people. They just wanna make you an employee not an independent contractor.",
      "My luggers listened \ud83d\udc42  to me grieve about losing my twin brother to Covid, this was more than professional this was human.",
      "Not user friendly at all\u2014 can\u2019t schedule a double pickup. No Notes section. This looks to be all by design. Prices are very high. \n\nProbably won\u2019t use again.",
      "I scheduled xl for studio apartment move.\nThey came to wrong address. \nThe crew did not arrive with correct vehicle.\nThey were slow, inexperienced, inefficient and sloppy with belongings. I gave them specific instructions how to pack effectively. Pack larger furniture items first and get everything out of apartment to loading dock. This did not happen. \n\nIn the time they milked the clock I packed van and suv and made three trips to new apartment. \n\nThey could not find new address. \n\nOn top of this, I had to simultaneously hire MORE movers to complete the job!\n\nI told this first crew to unpack at loading dock because i didn\u2019t want to pay them to WASTE more of my time by being slow AF and inefficient.\nThe second crew was AMAZING professional, had an actual xl truck and were kind enough to assist me in transporting ALL of the furniture the first crew left behind. \nThis second crew was about to get the items left at loading dock into my new unit in a FRACTION of the time the first crew WASTED by being slow AF. \n\nCustomer service did not respond to my multiple inquiries during this process. \nThey finally responded after they could not OVERCHARGE me for the first crew. \n\nI advised that I would pay for the actual services rendered but not for them milking the clock and not actually completing the move. I literally moved more than the first crew which completely defeated even hiring them in the first place- they were literally horrible and I hope no one is unlucky enough to hire them. \n\nThey charged me double of what it cost to move into my apartment with LUGG team with less furniture. \n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget I had to HIRE ANOTHER LUGG TEAM to complete their sloppy job\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate because moving is stressful enough and then to get robbed of your money and time is just not ok. \n\nSo book at your own risk!\nI happily PAID in full with generous tip, the SECOND TEAM. \n\nI have no intention of paying the padded fees of first team, yet will pay them for the limited service rendered but LUGG management wants more money...\n\nI suppose my witnesses, myself and my bank will now have to waste our time fighting being overcharged!\n\nReally too bad...",
      "I have been using this service regularly for the last year, and it was flawless until the last two times. The last 2 times that I requested a truck, they sent a VAN then tried to charge me more because the items will not fit in the van. Duh! That\u2019s why I ordered the truck.\n\nPoor movers come out for nothing. Lugg wastes everyone\u2019s time. If you need a van, just order a truck and you\u2019ll get one. Otherwise never using this app again"
