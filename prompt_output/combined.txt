* **Rivalry among existing competitors** - The rivalry among existing competitors in the moving industry is moderate. There are a number of moving companies that compete for customers, and the competition is often based on price and service.

* **Outbound logistics** - The activities involved in delivering the finished product or service to the customer.
* **Marketing and sales** - The activities involved in promoting and selling the product or service to the customer.
* **Customer service** - The activities involved in providing support to the customer after the sale has been made.

**Support activities** are the activities that provide support to the primary activities. These activities include:

* **Firm infrastructure** - The activities involved in managing the company's overall structure, including its human resources, financial resources, and physical resources.
* **Human resource management** - The activities involved in recruiting, training, and managing the company's employees.

Porter's Five Forces is a framework for analyzing the competitive environment of a business. The five forces are:

* **Threat of new entrants** - The threat of new entrants to the moving industry is low due to the high barriers to entry. These barriers include the need for specialized equipment, the need for experienced movers, and the need for a strong marketing presence.
* **Bargaining power of buyers** - The bargaining power of buyers in the moving industry is moderate. Buyers have a number of options to choose from, and they can easily switch to a different mover if they are not satisfied with the services they are receiving.
* **Bargaining power of suppliers** - The bargaining power of suppliers in the moving industry is low. There are a number of moving companies that are available to provide services, and suppliers have little ability to raise prices without losing customers.
* **Threat of substitutes** - The threat of substitutes in the moving industry is low. There are few substitutes for moving services, and customers are unlikely to switch to a different service if they are not satisfied with the services they are receiving.
* **Rivalry among existing competitors** - The rivalry among existing competitors in the moving industry is moderate. There are a number of moving companies that compete for customers, and the competition is often based on price and service.

**Value Chain Analysis**

A value chain analysis is a framework for understanding the activities that a business performs in order to create value for its customers. The value chain is divided into two main categories: primary activities and support activities.

**Primary activities** are the activities that are directly involved in the production and delivery of a product or service. These activities include:

* **Inbound logistics** - The activities involved in receiving, storing, and distributing inputs to the production process.
* **Operations** - The activities involved in transforming inputs into a finished product or service.
* **Outbound logistics** - The activities involved in delivering the finished product or service to the customer.
* **Marketing and sales** - The activities involved in promoting and selling the product or service to the customer.
* **Customer service** - The activities involved in providing support to the customer after the sale has been made.

**Support activities** are the activities that provide support to the primary activities. These activities include:

* **Firm infrastructure** - The activities involved in managing the company's overall structure, including its human resources, financial resources, and physical resources.
* **Human resource management** - The activities involved in recruiting, training, and managing the company's employees.
* **Technology development** - The activities involved in developing and implementing new technologies.
* **Procurement** - The activities involved in acquiring the resources needed to produce the product or service.

**Social, Technological, Economic, Environmental, and Political factors (STEEP)**
