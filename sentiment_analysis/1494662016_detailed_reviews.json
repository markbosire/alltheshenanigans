Do NOT send them any money!  \n\nI paid the fee to join the service thinking I would be able to get some quick moving hauling jobs and build a side income this way.  \n\nI submitted to literally 90% to 95% of the supposedly \u201cavailable\u201d jobs on the app and got ZERO responses back from hundreds of communications!  Couldn\u2019t even get a \u201cpiss off!\u201d Or a \u201cno thanks\u201d!  \n\nAnd when I communicated my displeasure via customer support I also got ZERO response back and it\u2019s not been well over a month since I joined.  \n\nWow! So incredible that this app is even here trying to scam people some more! \n\nYou have been warned! \n\nI truly wish I could give this app less than a 1 star! A negative five stars would be more appropriate",

They app really isn\u2019t functional to efficiently communicate with those seeking help (coming from the movers perspective). There is no way to view the location of the job you HAVE to apply to in order for the location to be shown. The contact information isn\u2019t available either. I still have a message in customer support (via the app) that hasn\u2019t been responded to (sent on 3/12/20 @2:19pm). I\u2019ve also sent a follow up email. Still no response. Overall, I completely wasted my $35 and I regret spending it with this company. Please stay away. You\u2019ve been warned. I would\u2019ve given 0 starts if I could.",
