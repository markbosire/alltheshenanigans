Sometimes i\u2019ll try to turn on a video, only to find that I\u2019m being prompted to buy a subscription I already purchased? Then it won\u2019t let me watch a video. \n\nWhoever engineered the video playing feature has clearly never used a feature like that. The scrolling feature is so sensitive. The slightest swipe anywhere on the screen tells the app that I am trying to scroll. Over half the time if I go to pause the video, the app thinks I\u2019ve scrolled back and starts over from the beginning. There should also be a feature to skip forward or backward at 15 or 30 second intervals, and scrolling should only be processed on the video time bar at the bottom.\n\nThe search function is really useful.\n\nThis app could really use a lot of improvements.",

I love the variety of workouts to choose from\u2026bag work, strength training, core, etc. My favorite is boxing and weights. I also love that they are always adding new varieties of workouts that are fun and challenging. I love that I can create playlists so at the beginning of the week I make a weekly folder with the workouts I want to do that week. Then I can always go back and see when I did the workouts. Thank you Title On Demand for making my workouts fun, effective and leaving me excited for the next!!",

Kickboxing, strength training, technique vids, and just straight up traditional title club boxing. Since COVID, my old title club remained closed for months (while still charging members full rate) for some seriously low quality zoom recordings and 30 min pre recorded workouts with terrible sound quality. This in comparison has been amazing. I use airplay to stream workouts from my iPad with no trouble at all. I haven\u2019t run into any glitches or bugs. I\u2019m thrilled.

I\u2019ve read the reviews and it seems like they\u2019ve fixed most of the problems the app had. Now, there\u2019s 2 reasons why I give it a 4 star rating. I have Beachbody on Demand and their music in their MANY programs is optional. I like having my own music. The music in these videos is always on though. Also there\u2019s still a few kinks to make better to be able to compete with how organized Beachbody is. Their programs are really organized and have a cheaper on Demand platform. One of their programs is like Title Boxing, but it\u2019s still not Title Boxing.",

      "text": "I used to live in Nashville, TN and was a long time member of a Title Boxing Club there. I got all the fundamentals down and was just obsessed with the workout. I moved to a small town and the closest TBC is probably 3 or so hours away. My gym has a punching bag so I tried to mimic the workouts but it was just never the same without a trainer shouting out the combos, etc. I recently downloaded this app and am so happy I did. For anyone who has the fundamentals down but doesn\u2019t live near a TBC, I think this app is great! There are a lot of shadow boxing workouts but I just do the same combos on the heavy bag and it\u2019s great. My only complains are that I wish there were more intermediate and advanced boxing workouts and I wish there were more 45 minute workouts or just 30 minute workouts with only boxing\u2014no warm up or core. I find myself doing 2-3 of the 15 minute boxing workouts because I usually run or do my own warm up before I box and I wish they had more videos available with 8 rounds of boxing that I could just run straight through. I also wish more videos for boxing were updated more often. I feel like I repeat the same few every week. All in all, a pretty good option if you\u2019ve got the fundamentals down but don\u2019t live near a boxing gym.",
