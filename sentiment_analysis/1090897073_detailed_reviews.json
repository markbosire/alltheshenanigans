I receive a call a day before the pick up apologizing for not being able to \"carry\" the TV due to its size. This is a real shame. Promising big and delivering small, in this case, not delivering at all! And the worst thing is, the customer service give an alternative date or try to find a solution! It's like she doesn't care if I use their service or not! This is just a perfect example of how to fail on \"carry\"ing.",

They never keep up with the time promise, they don't deliver to the right address, the customer service representatives sound like a they are talking from their houses, and worst (and worrying) I get charged from my credit card while the app shows an error! This is simply the perfect recipe for failure, it's as if they're not even trying. What a bunch of hacks!",
