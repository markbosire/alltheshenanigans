      "text": "I had a terrible experience with one of the drivers. I accidentally typed in the wrong address and messaged the driver. He was not that far away from the location where I was at. I tried to explain that there was a different route which would be a much shorter drive regarding the flood warning. But he wouldn\u2019t even let me speak and gave me an attitude. We hung up the call, I sent him a text and advised that I could cancel the trip and schedule a different driver. He then calls me to start arguing with me and told me to do whatever I wanted and playing the blame game with me regarding the wrong address. I already accepted fault and apologized. Overall, very unprofessional. I messaged the people of customer service and they basically told me the driver is not obligated to drive if I sent the wrong address. The point was how I was treated by the driver, even after apologizing. Terrible.",

As the seller was moving, I needed to secure delivery quickly.  \n\nI found GoShare online. Its like Uber for deliveries.  \n\nUsing the app, i entered the pick up and delivery locations, details and a photo of the furniture. A driver picked up the job in less than 5 minutes. \n\nI received a text notification from GoShare letting me know the project had been assigned.  I had a few more details to relay. Jason replied quickly letting me know the information would be relayed to the driver. I was impressed that a real person handled the information.  \n\nThe delivery was successful. The driver communicated all steps of the project and delivered the furniture safely. \n\nUpon delivery, drivers mark the end of the project, and take a photo of the delivered item. This is saved in the app for your records.  \n\nThe app is easy to use, indicates progress, handles payment and tips efficiently.  Users can see an itemized break down of the final charges before paying.  \n\nThere is a charge if the delivery takes longer than expected.  My project did take longer as the driver encountered traffic. \n\nI was happy with my GoShare experience and will use the service again!",

These drivers bring their own vehicles and maybe driving from somewhere far away or local so\u201dcan\u2019t be accountable on exact time\u201d. \n\nMy 2nd problem that I came across is that the white van that show up wasn\u2019t a \u201ccargo vehicle\u201d that I reserved so the driver had to make 2 trips and was upset by that. What got to me is that the van was able to hold 2 boxes max -make 2trips-took more time waiting for him to drive back to my house and I was charged for a \u201ccargo vehicle\u201d! \n\nThere were some communication mistakes for sure!

Plus as a single older person who is no longer able to do the heavy lifting required to get this monster home, Goshare was my answer!!! The app was really easy to use for same-day (or pre-arranged delivery). I just uploaded pick up and drop off locations, size of vehicle needed, and number number of workers to do the job. I got a free estimate to see if I wanted to purchase (and by the way, the delivery fee rivals any store delivery fee), and done! The service was excellent. Workers came to pick it up and the drop off was seamless. I totally highly recommend this service for any delivery or move.",

The store where I purchased the furniture initially sent the deliverers out with the incorrect furniture. The deliverers retuned the furniture back to the store to which I made the purchase and brought back the correct furniture. Due to the extra time regarding the store\u2019s error I am being charged additional because it took more time for the delivery to be made. The store does not compensate me for that time nor GoShare. \n\nThe deliverers were professional and followed my directions. I would utilize the service from GoShare. Because it was a easy process. Customer service was available and responded quickly. Inspite of the above hassle I still would give a 5 star rating.",

But when it comes time to enter in credit card information, you have to type everything in manually, and then when you hit the submit button, all the payment information is deleted.

Your only option is to go back to the previous screen where you find out that your payment information was not added and that there is no payment information associated with your account. I have tried this several times over and over and it produces the same problem. This app simply refuses to add payment information. So as far as I can tell it is unusable!

I downloaded the GoShare app and entered pickup and delivery addresses,  picked type of truck and put in payment with credit card .\nWithin 30 minutes I received a response from my driver and his eta.  I was blown away that less than 2 hours after purchase, the furniture was delivered at my house. This was a Sunday night !  My delivery driver was the best!    Thank you GoShare !",

When the driver showed up to the address he stated the treadmill will need to be taken apart. I asked where the helper was and he said he is running late. The helper arrived an hour late. I helped the driver with the disassembly. Once apart I helped the driver with moving the pieces to his truck. Just to point out, I\u2019m still recovering from major ankle surgery. The helper arrived when the last piece was being moved. I stil was needed to help as they were not able to lift the piece. When they arrived with the items to my home I simply said to just use the outside entrance to the basement, place the pieces inside and I will take of the rest. Again, I found myself being needed to help with lifting. The personnel that was tasked with the job knew ahead of time what they were moving. The customer should not be tasked with moving the items. Also I was charged overtime for the incompetence of the moving squad. I was offered a $20 discount. The overtime charge should have been waived due to the circumstances.If I did not help with the lifting I\u2019m sure the charge would have been much higher. Will be using another platform for sure with the next project!",

Instead, I saw the GoShare sign in Home Goods & downloaded the app, created an account & the guy was there in no time. It was so great all across the board & I cannot wait to use this service again.

      "text": "These are not personal issues, but general concerns that should be addressed for all users of the app and service. :\n\nThis is the big one:\nWhen making a reservation, pickup was at a location away from mine. So, I changed the address from my current location to the pickup location. Seeing that I missed entering the unit number,  I went back to add unit # to the address. At that point the app defaulted to change the pickup location to my personal physical location miles away from the actual intended pickup location. I almost didn\u2019t see that it changed automatically.  \nThe app should not change the location that I had entered. The fact that I was in edit mode means that I was handling the addresses - don\u2019t need it to revert to anything.  Perhaps there could be a <use current location> button instead if the intention is for the app o be helpful. Otherwise it\u2019s the opposite of helpful. \n\nPerhaps the issue could be avoided if the unit number had available an \u201caddress line 2\u201d instead of having to be input into the \u201cspecial notes\u201d or \u201cadditional info\u201d  (how ever it\u2019s worded).  My driver didn\u2019t even see that it was in the notes because\n It wasn\u2019t part of the address in the app. \n\nIf I didn\u2019t see that I was reverted, driver would be at the wrong address and would likely cancel, therefor would cost extra, frustrate me and cause delays.\n\nSo, there are two things to change that are  critical to this app: \n1.) the app should not default to current location once a different location was already entered to change it from current location; and\n2.) An \u201caddress line 2\u201d or unit number should be added to the pickup location.\n\nThe app has a glitch in the customer support portion (went to to a blank screen a couple times). \n\nFinally, There is no way to share the app from within the app. I needed to come back to the App Store to share it. Not convenient. If you seriously want us to share your app, then you should make it as easy as possible to do so.  \n\nYou alone have the power to make these changes. \nMake it so. It would be magnificent if the developers actually used the apps they develop. Don\u2019t just go through it as if it was the real thing. Actually use the service. That\u2019s how apps become great.",

Seconds after I finished, Stephen L. had accepted my job.  I was shocked!  He went out the same evening to pick up my sofa.  Seeing where he was and the progress on line was so reassuring.  Unfortunately, on his way back to my place, the weather decided not to cooperate.  I called him & he was willing to wait until the storm was over or keep my sofa until the morning.  He had excellent communication with me at all times and since the water was ankle high in front of my door, we decided to finish the next morning.  I was so impressed with his service.  It\u2019s rare to find someone who goes the extra mile to make things work.  Stephen L. did that & more.  I will use GoShare in the future and ask for Stephen L. because I trust him with my purchases.",

Goshare provided cost estimate and move duration based on what was provided by us but the truck selected was very small.  Matter of fact the company did not have larger trucks to complete our move.  Since the company does not provide large truck, the driver had to make multiple trips to complete the move which took longer and ultimately increased our move cost significantly.  Instead of GoShare taking the responsibility for sending a small truck and absorbing the additional cost, they charged us for the mistake.   We will be challenging their cost.  Since they have no larger trucks, it tells me that the company is doing this intentionally to bump up their profit margins which should be an unethical practice.",

But the issue is that they don\u2019t do this very well, I suspect because the company is weak and cannot control the \u201cindependent contractors\u201d it is trying to connect to customers. My experience has been that I schedule a pick-up/drop-off with them on the app, which goes well and smoothly. Then, I get a barrage of text messages (why not use the app? Isn\u2019t that the point of an App?) telling me about drivers rescheduling, cancelling, wrong size truck sizes arriving, and basically, a lot of your time being wasted and you realise that going to the local U-haul and hiring the couple of day workers there (actually the same guys who do the job anyway!) would have been quicker, less stressful, and easier. So, yes, it is trying to cater to our modern age of \u201cfaceless connections\u201d and technology based basic services, but it miserably fails to do so. I am not sure why Uber works and GoShare doesn\u2019t, but the facts lie before you.",

The app is simple to use and we confirmed a next day delivery within minutes of setting up the app. My only complaint is the pricing - which was on the high side for the delivery of only two chairs in my opinion. However, timing was more important than money in this instance so I can\u2019t complain too much. If I wasn\u2019t under time pressure, it would have been less than half the price to simply rent a Home Depot truck for a couple of hours and do the delivery myself with a friend. I guess the old adage of \u201cYou pay for convenience\u201d is certainly true for GoShare.",

I was told I was going to charged a cancellation fee even though it had been pending for 30 min and they told me it would be much later until someone could except it.

The furniture came bundled directly from the store and was wrapped in plastic wrap. The movers brought a headboard and footboard up the stairs that was wrapped together instead of unwrapping it; bringing it up together made the items very heavy and bulky. The same was done for an armoire. Instead of unwrapping it and taking out the drawers to make it lighter they brought it up the stairs in tact with a very heavy dolly. The stairs walls were banged and scratched very heavily. The movers left all of the trash in the front yard. I was expecting professional movers. The movers were just unfamiliar with what they were doing it seemed like. They didn\u2019t have moving apparatuses which make lifting heavy objects easy like straps. They didn\u2019t seem very strong. I was really worried they were going to damage more than just the walls. I was worried they were going to damage the furniture or hurt themselves. I\u2019ve moved a lot in my lifetime as I am a military spouse. I\u2019ve never felt this uneasy about my items being moved. Only one person stayed behind to assemble a bed. I had to help the mover which was very uncomfortable. He did not know how to assemble the bed. I will not use the service again.",

If I could rate negative stars I would- one star is way too high. I scheduled a job to be delivered to my 2nd floor. They abandoned the furniture on my first floor. The movers dragged my furniture on the pavement with no protection damaging them. I had to send multiple messages to the company over days to actually get any kind of response re: completing the delivery and the damage. Response was akin to, first we don\u2019t cover damage the movers do, then too bad we don\u2019t agree our guys caused the damage so you\u2019re on your own, and finally up to you to get your stuff upstairs too bad we couldn\u2019t complete the project as agreed and scheduled.

The driver came ready with his cargo truck; and loaded/unloaded/handled my couches carefully- very professional with mover blankets and wrapping- I was impressed! Customer service was easy to contact through the app- I had the same representative for two days so she was able to assist me and answer all of my questions!  The whole service and all the moving parts of many people involved was smooth! I am so happy, thank you!",

I have receipts to prove I was overcharged but still it is unfortunate that this happened. The delivery went smooth but this billing is a nightmare. Don\u2019t use this service they may be convenient but obviously they have hidden fees (They can\u2019t explain them) and no one likes to use a service that is not upfront about cost. They have no customer service line to call, only chatbot so Goodluck getting in touch with a human about any concerns you have.",

They then charged me over $900 and even had the nerve to ask for a tip.

      "text": "We scheduled a move for a Peloton exercise bike and 5 Boxes from Manhattan to Long Island. I booked this ~ 2weeks prior to the move. I was notified via the app that my one driver  and one helper were both confirmed. Out of an abundance of caution I reached out to the Driver 5 days prior to the scheduled pick up and found him to be pleasant and well informed. I reviewed the fact that the Peoloton would require two people as it will need to be taken up one flight of stairs and is very heavy. He confirmed that he understood. On the day of pickup I also texted the driver and got a friendly \u201c see you there\u201d.  One hour prior to the scheduled pick up I received a call from Go Share customer support that they \u201ccan\u2019t find a helper\u201d and could the driver manage alone? I reminded them that the order is clearly visible to them and that it is impossible for any one Person to make the move. After many escalations and back and forth they asked to create a new  project and hope that a pickup could be arranged by 4pm that day. I had a larger move scheduled the next day so I had no flexibility. Meanwhile the original driver is texting me from downstairs a bit u certain of what he is supposed to do.  The experience overall was so stressful I would never do it again. This team has a long way to go to ensure that the coordination, communication and support measures in place really work to make it a reliable \u201csmall move\u201d company. Of note the driver and helper who did end up coming were kind and hard working. The issue seems to be more structural and administrative. As of 7:30pm I am still waiting for a call from a manager that I was assured would\nHappen.",

I was told this amount by a CS rep by chat and an email of the chat history was sent to me. Two hours later, that email was erased by GoShare. Another email was sent in its place saying now I was now being charged $294. I looked in my checking account....They already took it out of my account!!!  I will be disputing this. It\u2019s funny that the chat history and previous email was withdrawn to cover themselves. So, really, the company scammed me after the fact. The movers told me I wasn\u2019t going to be charged anything other than the estimate. Additionally, they damaged my floor. They admitted to it. Now let\u2019s see if GoShare will pay for the damages or try and say it was not their fault. I will never recommend this service to anyone, nor use it again, unless the company rectified this huge huge mistake.",

Paid extra for a dolly and ramp. the driver arrived after transporting it from Arlington Va to DC on its side (a basic no-no). No dolly and no ramp. Pulled the refrigerator out of his pickup across his tailgate, dragged it across our cement stairs, then tried to place it on a small square wooden appliance buggy. \n\nAfter further scrapes and watching them try and lift it  damaging it more I had them leave it on my patio blocking access to my garage and alley. Nathan at GoShare tried to help and lined up someone for the next morning. \n\nThat person never called or showed. After talking with Brandi and Emilie trying to figure a plan that wasn't \"what's the latest we can take care of it\" and offering suggestions and options they could try, I was transferred to Marissa. She told me that they would not be refunding my original delivery or paying for someone to complete the job. When I told her that is not what Nathan indicated she disconnect our chat and blocked my ability to access customer service through the app. \n\nAfter being ghosted by Customer Service for 24 hours I paid some else else to move it in my house only to discover the transport damage rendered the unit inoperable. \n\nStill nothing on numerous texts or emails. \n\nBuyer beware!!",

I created an account, arranged for a pickup and delivery of my freezer.  I was quoted $54.95 for my delivery.  The CRAZY thing is that I did not authorize GoShare to hold anything from my bank account nor was I previously informed.  I have 2 transactions on my account... one for $100 and the other for $54.95.  Then they have the nerve to have these funds being held until Tuesday!  When a person does not agree to a hold on their bank account, or been advised of a hold on their account being put on their bank account, that can be considered as FRAUD.  \n\nI have made 3 attempts to reach customer service via email, but they haven\u2019t responded to me at all.

It was not tall enough so the frige stayed on the dolly at an angle. I was not at the receiving end to inspect, but was originally told it arrived ok, so I gave them 5 star ratings. Later I learned the side of the frige was scratched in the transport. I noticed that the dolly/hand truck was smaller than a regular appliance size dolly (which I thought I had paid for). Also, I don\u2019t believe it had anything to protect the metal from the appliance, thus the scratching. It was in excellent condition before this trip. I have seen pics of the scratches and they will have to be painted over. Had it not been for this damage I would highly recommend them. They should have used a professionally sized appliance dolly, like the one that delivered my new frige. This frige went to a friend and now I will try to cover up the ugly scratching as best I can. I can only recommend this service for items that are already worn or scratched.",

Put in info for an estimate ($10 more than ArtVan charged me- so knew it was in the ballpark) so I submitted request. Almost immediately my job got picked up. I called Corey who was assigned to me just to see if he needed any more info to get my order from distribution center. He asked me to text my invoice, and he was able to get my order no problem. Getting it in my house however, turned out to be quite a challenge! We had to take off doors, try several different angles, but they were pro\u2019s and got it in!! I was very impressed with them and tipped their excellent service. The only surprise was that the job took quite a bit longer than original estimate, but with a good reason. I didn\u2019t realize I had to finish the transaction online afterwards. I thought it got charged automatically. \n\nI would definitely use GoShare again!!!",

      "text": "I had two helpers hired to move a fridge. It took them an extra 45 minutes because neither had never moved a fridge before and had no clue how to disconnect the water line. They were both very courteous, but not exactly the right guys for the job. The only reason the job was competed was bc my general contractor showed up and showed them how to do it. GoShare reviewed my competed and waiver request for the extra $100 in time charged and declined to do anything about it. So if hiring incompetent workers is your jam, GoShare may be for you. But if you, like me, thought when you pay someone $105 for 30 min of their time that they would be competent, then you should look elsewhere. Will not use again.",

Reviewing my account this evening, I was charged $373.76. I sent a message and received no response. I want my $133.08 that I was overcharged and I probably won\u2019t be using this service again because of this dishonesty.
