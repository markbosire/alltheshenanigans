      "text": "Tried to select rides within the service area but no rights available. it would be useful to have some colored areas on the map to let user know where roseville arrow and placer go available. Useless, Another government app that's super clutery. I am sure they paid top dollars to develop it. probably an uncle/vousin won the bid with very little oversight. Another example of waste of tax payers doolars.",
