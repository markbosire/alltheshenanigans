      "text": "Sorry but this app is complete garbage!! When I started I was getting paid 50$ to pick up tires in Plainfield and drop off in Greenwood. 15 mile trip. Now that same route pays 19$.\n\nAlmost every single offer that pops up requires me to drive 30 miles just to get there then another 15 miles to pick up and drop off. Not to mention the 30+ miles to drive back home. But year 17.99$ should cover the gas, so if you like working for free then I\u2019d say it\u2019s a great app. Otherwise don\u2019t waste your time your not compensated for your labor they basically pay your gas and that\u2019s it.",

I drive with GoShare and my payment can never be tracked by me, the payment method is very ridiculous and it\u2019s not transparent. Sometimes, some payments will be added together without indicating what project it was by adding project numbers, which makes it very difficult for me as a driver to track my payment as they are paid out to me. Some payments will be paid alone, sometimes payments will be paid randomly by picking one from the top and leave like 2 in the middle unpaid and one will also be paid from the bottom and this makes me lose track of my payments as a driver. This payment method is not transparent and it\u2019s a very bad style because sometimes some of my payments are never even paid. GoShare should try to be more transparent concerning payment and make it trackable for drivers also. This will make everyone happy.",

So I would be late getting there if I accepted it. I wish you had no less than an hour to get to the location just in case you happen to be over 30 minutes away. I haven\u2019t accepted a single project due to that issue alone. I also assumed there would consistently be projects available, when reality is it\u2019s 1 or 2 every few hours. Which is fine, I just thought there would be more activity. It is a side hustle so I get notified a lot when I'm already at work and barely when I\u2019m actually off. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

When I registered there was no orders almost ever, that was especially said because I had to pay $150 for my background check(you have to pay for BC but not everybody pays $150 only those who ever lived in NY). So it\u2019s not a reliable income not even supplement. 2-3 months later business picked up a little, there is one company that sends orders ones a day on the first come first served basis. So I got my first order but when I arrived and waited in line for about 30 min(the whole thing took about an hour) the guy in charge said he doesn\u2019t have my order in the system. Also you are independent contractor so no body will compensate you for time, gas, etc. To summarize \n1. Not enough orders and compensation is not grate to say the least \n2. Long wait time at the pick up location plus you might not even get your order.\n3. Lack of item description usually it\u2019s something like 1-gag mag dag 3pc 46?)8\u2019frtu, that\u2019s your description, I just never know if it is going to fit in my car:)\n3. People at the pick up are poorly organized, to them you just a nuisance.\n4. Orders usually have to be picked up at certain time which means you have to be close which means more unpaid time waiting in the area.\n5. GoShare is not transparent about earnings in specific areas\nBig plus to GoShare support team, they respond really fast. \nI wouldn\u2019t recommend unless you are traveling the same way as the package and you can allocate the time, again this is courier experience(cars/small cars).",

I have had several great delivery experiences thus week.  Customers are so grateful for my help and the feeling of helping is very fulfilling.  GoShare is so easy to work with and for. Customer service is very responsive and very helpful. Payments have been quick and estimated job payments have been accurate.  The only challenge is beating out the competition for jobs, since it\u2019s first-come, first-serve. Got to be quick, responding to notifications!  What an excellent system too!  Using a smart phone, an app, and my truck to make money.  My Apple Watch is also a very useful part of the technology. Thanks GoShare for providing these opportunities, for helping me make money and serve others, and for helping customers with their needs. It\u2019s a Win, Win for All!!  Sincerely, Alan G.",

They have only ladies handling the accounting department and those ladies have no mercy they are rude, they don\u2019t talk to you\u2026they charge your credit card for penalty for showing up and e-mail you the receipt for the amount took. If the driver cancel the pickup for some reason and becomes more than their limit they charge you penalty and take money \u2026they have only chat window sometimes nobody would respond for hours\u2026no one will talk to you one on one when you are in need, if they need to talk to you they will and they expect you to answer the phone., that is slavery. Basically they treat drivers like trash. Sometimes they have long haul deliveries for solar companies, they pay only one way tolls and they don\u2019t pay tolls for you coming home if it\u2019s longer than 8hr drive they don\u2019t pay for hotel stay, they expect you drive back immediately or don\u2019t care if you drive immediately\u2026.that makes 16hrs of driving which is not allowed. All other apps like this give Deadhead ($ per mile) to comeback home after drop off. This GoShare doesn\u2019t give you a penny not even tolls to come back\u2026instead they take money from your credit card without your authorization\u2026.be careful of this scams.",

If you accept a helper job and there\u2019s no main driver, they will reschedule the pickup for a different time, even though you just spent an hour driving to the location. If you accept a job and have to reschedule for bad weather, they charge you a $20 fee. It could be a good way to earn money. It just isn\u2019t.",

But , that\u2019s because I was waiting for the punchline . My mistake . It\u2019s as good as it says it is . Now to why I didn\u2019t give 5 . It\u2019s more my fault I think . Customer service is very thorough and on top of making sure the customer is getting a professional and on time driver. They make sure all is good . Just a tad impersonal when it\u2019s comes to their drivers at least in my case . But , In the end it all turned out well . $$$$$ so no 5 stars til I get more work lol .",

It is unfortunate that we were not able to work with this company but considering the absolute hypocrisy of saying use the cargo van. And they don\u2019t want to hire you. It\u2019s obvious from my standpoint that this is most likely fraudulent company. I will not ever ever use the service. For my own deliveries to be made or vice versa. And I will tell all my drivers to not use the service. It is unfortunate but I would strongly recommend Apple remove this service from their platform. Delivery drivers should be allowed the option to outsource their delivery vans and rent them if need be without having to provide all kinds of proof. I do all the background checks on my drivers. Do not use this service stay away it is obvious they are only wanting to rip people off. I cannot abide by fraudulent companies saying one thing and then doing a complete 180 on another. In business you have to be honest and forthcoming and you cannot be discriminatory on who you hire. I recommend the federal government checking in on this as well.

That\u2019s a cost of doing business that should fall on the company, definitely not the contractor. No other app or company has ever asked me to pay for a background fee. \n- They charge a cancellation fee to drivers ranging from $10-50. How ridiculous. Their video tries to explain how it is not a punishment but there\u2019s no going around it. Your parent/spouse/child suddenly in the hospital? Pay up. You get in a car accident? Pay up. \n- To move on with the onboarding process you half to watch a HALF HOUR LONG video that explains nothing but common sense, and about 7 minutes explaining the clumsy flow of this app. AND THEN you have to answer a 41, forty one, question quiz on the video. It\u2019s easier to sign up to deliver people (which doesn\u2019t say anything good about uber or Lyft either \ud83d\ude02)\n\nThere\u2019s better apps and services to use. I will not be recommending this company to customers or other gig economists.",

Nothing works, went back to the online chat, were the second person told me there was never a chat in the first place. Long story short ended up like the first time. Applying process is super annoying, no support at all. I\u2019m very disappointed in this app. Tried to download the app multiple times nothing has changed. Tried it over the web page, seems to be worse.",

This is a brand new truck with a valid inspection sticker on the windshield valid for 4 years. I do not understand the \u201cNEED\u201d to do another inspection.

Nonetheless, I am very frustrated with my experience so far. In the last 3 days I haven\u2019t been able to get but 1 project. For some reason I am not getting requests to my app. I only receive emails which I reply with the word \u201caccept\u201d, but most times, nothing happens. I deleted the app and downloaded it again and it is the same thing. I borrowed a friends phone and downloaded the app on his phone and I was able then, through her phone, to accept the 1 job I have been able to do. I triple checked and my phone have push notifications activated. I don\u2019t know what seems to be the problem, and I have only been able to communicate via text messages with your support team. \nJust right now I received an email with a project but nothing on the app! This is very frustrating! As of right now, I am in the negative with GoShare. I haven\u2019t been able to even recuperate the cost of the background check. I will really appreciate some technical support with this app. I have friends that have trucks and were all waiting to see what was my experience, to see if it was worth it before they move forward or pay the background check. As of right now, my experience has been very frustrating and disappointing. Please, I need some technical support. Thanks in advance.",
