I paid the driver 150 AED in cash as agreed, but later, the app kept asking me for a separate payment through the app. Despite providing proof of payment to the driver, the support team kept insisting on additional payment.\n\nThis kind of confusion and lack of communication between the app and its drivers is disappointing. Until they improve their payment system and customer support, I\u2019d recommend being cautious when using this service.",
