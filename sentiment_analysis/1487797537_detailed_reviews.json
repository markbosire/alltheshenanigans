      "text": "This app is a hot wet mess. It\u2019s beta at best, and has not even gone through basic QA. I will say it\u2019s functional, but only barely. You can\u2019t make changes nor can the movers once they have accepted a job. So you have to contact support to remove one guy, so it frees up the spot to find another helper. Would benefit from some gui/spatial changes to make it more user friendly and/or less intimidating overall.\n\nVisionary/executive/owner/coach?: Storyboard the entire application with branches of what goes to what storyboard. Then look at all your storyboards and redesign to cut the storyboards in half at least. \n\nThe idea is great, and has potential to grab a return and expanding customer base. You have to bring customer engagement down, simplify the order process. It needs to be as easy as Uber/Lyft. A metric to shoot for is easier than Ubereats, that app is still a convoluted mess in places to accommodate all the different restaurants and what have you. You\u2019re defining the service/service level so you can trim and shape to simplify/make brainless easy.\n\n(AWS backend?)",

I contracted for 2 helpers, and 1 canceled at the last minute. The problem is: trying to get to a real person to get anything done didn\u2019t happen. After Dylan, the helper that showed up tried contact you by phone, all we got was a voicemail. That doesn\u2019t help me when I\u2019m in need of a agreed second helper. Almost 3 hours later, you assigned another person, by it was too late. \n2. That being said, the guy that DID show up, Dylan was GREAT! Hard worker, and easy to get along with. I\u2019m almost 68 years old, in decent health, but had I not been, this could have been a catastrophe. Too bad all your helpers aren\u2019t as good as Dylan!",

They would have been helpful the time I bought a chair at HomeGoods without thinking and ended up sitting on the curb with it looking for someone who could help me get it home. \nThey are super fast, efficient and affordable.",
