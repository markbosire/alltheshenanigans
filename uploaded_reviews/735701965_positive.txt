I wish you would tell the customer in advance if the waiting time would be longer than estimated. ☹️ It took an extra 2 hours just to get my item delivered. I would have liked to have a choice in that. Customer service is almost useless
Better to state your markets upfront. It’s not available anywhere. I tried it in China and it didn’t work. It supposedly requires another app to use. Anywhere is contextual then. It makes sense to be upfront with clarity to the person downloading.
Motorista parou a entrega por não ter recebido pedagio, nem sabia sobre ter ou não pedagio, não chegou a tempo e sumiu com o produto. Empresa com suporte de atendimento ruim, ainda está para resolver a situação.
Nascent service, with room to improve.
Fast and good
This is a Chinese company looking to steal intellectual property from US companies to support their global expansion 👎👎
User friendly, real time and efficient. 👍🏼
Try this app if you love getting beeped about promotions and offers. Not.
Thanks for going above and beyond your duty.. Sa uulitin.. Kudos!! You deserve a 5 Star..😁😁😁😁
Driver came on time and was very helpful. Would like to commend Erickson Manzano for being nice and respectful. A must keep lalamove driver!Will definitely use the app again. Keep it up. 👍🏻😊
Apps is very useful with good services, good manner and punctual drivers.
Needed to move some furniture from a friend's house. Called Lalamove, and the person I was matched with was really friendly and helpful! Would use again!!
never thought about writing a review before, but lalamove deserved this one. the driver was really nice and using the app was so smooth and easy, and a lot cheaper than other delivery services here in HK. wish u guys all the best
Good service with reasonable price.
You can try to find an alternative but Lalamove is the only real option when you need a delivery service that is fast, reliable, and cost effective.
In theory, an app is created so that one may automate and create a more seamless experience for the end user. Maybe save some time, possibly create a tool that's useful. This experience may come in the form of ordering a taxi, food for your meal or a rideshare car. 

Allegedly that's what lalamove tried to do. But while the App may look shiny and is considerably user friendly, it fails in all other aspects that may suggest a more automated or seamless experience. Some examples- why did I get 8 missed calls from their customer service after using their App? Why was I not able to resolve the issue after the 4 subsequent calls with their team? Why were there multiple drivers calling me? Why didn't the driver correct call me in the first place? Why was I negotiating with the driver til close to midnight on the phone? 

While training and basic customer service etiquette seemed utterly devoid from my interaction with the lalamove team, it seems the biggest shortfall is in how NOT streamlined the experience is. What should have been a 1 minute App experience turned into a combined 3 hour ordeal. I hope the lalamove team gets it and fixes their approach to their service, as well as reconsider the end users' journey post-click. It Best of luck.
After little luck with various "man-with-a-van" services and lots of hassles with schedules and extra charges, this app was a breath of fresh air! The user interface works well and it is easy to select the options you need. The price is clear (as long as you don't go over the time or up stairs) and reasonable too. The best part is not being at the mercy of someone else's schedule! Thanks Easy Van!
Easy and efficient. Perfect if you have no car.
Too many variables in services available for this app to be effective. You order a pick up and a driver accepts it. You make arrangements. Driver then changes time. You reluctantly agree and adjust the arrangements. Driver shows up and wants to change price because the stars have not quite aligned for him...... Just call a guy out of the local classified and save some money and grief. Oh yeah, just try using the 'discount voucher' with the driver...... Good luck!
I like the convenience for having options like this service.
Driver canceled at the assigned pick up time.  This is despite calling a half hour before the pick up to confirm the pick up.  I used this service to get a van because my family has too much luggage to fit in a taxi.  When the driver canceled my family was stranded.  This service is unreliable and their is obviously zero vetting of the drivers.  Avoid this app at all costs!
Fast reply great service, great app!
Excellent, fast service as very reasonable rates. Highly recommended especially if you need is delivery (no assembly)! Very pleased with this option and makes it easier when we have to shop at Ikea now.
Highly recommended. I don't speak Cantonese nor Mandarin. I used this app and I got a van in 10 minutes to move my stuff.

The software is easy to use. The response from drivers is almost instantaneous. However, the price quoted in the app will be at minimum half of what drivers request even if you add a large tip.
