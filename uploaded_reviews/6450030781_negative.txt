I have used this company four times this past year and I could not be happier with their service. They always make their expected arrival time. They are knowledgeable and skilled in moving your furniture. The movers are pleasant and confirm that they have met your expectations.
Donâ€™t hesitate to use them. Valerie Klein
Great Service, my in laws bought some new furniture but had no car to pick up. Thru the Muvr App I was able to get same day services to deliver furniture to their homes.
