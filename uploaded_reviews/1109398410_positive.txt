Had an amazing first time experience with Porter. Very affordable price and excellent service. Asim, my rider, was very accomodating and professional. Keep it up, Porter! 👏👏👏
Porter
I recently used the Porter app to send a truck for delivery in Dubai. While the service itself was convenient, the payment experience was frustrating. I paid the driver 150 AED in cash as agreed, but later, the app kept asking me for a separate payment through the app. Despite providing proof of payment to the driver, the support team kept insisting on additional payment.

This kind of confusion and lack of communication between the app and its drivers is disappointing. Until they improve their payment system and customer support, I’d recommend being cautious when using this service.
So helpful,  proper pick up and drop off
Easy to book a delivery. Prompt real time tracking of the vehicle , right from booking to delivery. Transparent transactions. Price is reasonable.
