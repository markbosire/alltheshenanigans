I had tried downloading the app to use it, and it seemed to download fine, until I tried to open the app, and it would glitch out and close out on me. I had deleted the app and tried to reinstall it again, and again, it repeated the same issue. I’m a bit perturbed that I can’t use your services.
I signed up today to use the app and had to call my son to read the text to me. 

Font is way too small- there’s no way this is ADA compliant (No, I am not handicap).  I also had to dig around to find out someone accepted the job and now I am waiting.  Not sure what’s next.
